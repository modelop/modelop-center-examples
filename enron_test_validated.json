PG&E, ISO agree to court order on power bills By Claire Cooper Bee Staff Writers (Published June 6, 2001)=20 SAN FRANCISCO -- Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and the operator of=20 California's power grid agreed Tuesday to a preliminary court order providi= ng=20 that the utility will continue to receive -- but not pay -- generators' bil= ls=20 for the state's purchases of the most expensive wholesale electricity.=20 The tab has been running at about $300 million a month.=20 The order, which U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali said he'll sign, will= =20 specify that the Independent System Operator will not procure power except= =20 for a \"creditworthy buyer who has agreed to pay the generator.\"=20 In California, the only such potential buyer is the state Department of Wat= er=20 Resources. However, the department, which has avoided PG&E Co.'s bankruptcy= =20 proceedings by claiming sovereign immunity, will not be controlled by the= =20 agreement. Montali pointed out that the department still could demand=20 reimbursement from PG&E.=20 Under the agreement, the ISO will not press any claims against PG&E on beha= lf=20 of generators if they are not paid.=20 The proposed preliminary injunction was based on an April order by the=20 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which forbade the ISO from purchasing= =20 power on behalf of any non-creditworthy buyer, such as PG&E.=20 The ISO is appealing the FERC order. If the appeal succeeds, the injunction= =20 will end.=20 Peter Schrag: Turning up the heat in Houston and Washington (Published June 6, 2001)=20 Behind all the palaver about the predictable standoff at last week's energy= =20 \"summit\" between President Bush and Gov. Gray Davis, one major political=20 development was missed.=20 Put simply, in the past month the focus of the California energy crisis, an= d=20 maybe the onus as well, has moved east: from the state's (and Davis')=20 handling of the mess to the generating companies, energy marketers and gas= =20 pipeline companies that have richly profited from it, and thus to FERC, the= =20 do-next-to-nothing Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the Bush=20 administration.=20 That wasn't all Davis' doing -- far from it -- though it's been at the hear= t=20 of his message about energy industry \"pirates\" and \"profiteers.\" Bush's=20 misbegotten energy plan and the administration's political clumsiness also= =20 contributed mightily, not least by inadvertently giving Davis the chance to= =20 get media exposure he could only have dreamed about.=20 More important, there's the defection of Sen. James Jeffords from the=20 Republican Party and the resulting shift of control in the U.S. Senate, whe= re=20 the next chair of the Energy Committee will be Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New=20 Mexico, a co-sponsor of Sen. Dianne Feinstein's bill capping wholesale=20 electric rates for the next two years. And chairing the Committee on=20 Governmental Affairs will be Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, who's=20 already asked for an audit of energy prices.=20 Those changes will draw a lot more attention to recent studies showing that= a=20 handful of big generators -- Duke Power, Reliant, Mirant, Dynegy and the hu= ge=20 energy-marketing firm Enron -- have gamed the market to drive wholesale=20 prices to levels that, in the year 2000, sometimes reached 40 times the=20 prices of the year before.=20 The findings come not merely from economists at the California Independent= =20 System Operator, the agency that manages the state's grid, who estimate=20 overcharges resulting from market power at $6.2 billion for last year alone= .=20 They come also from Severin Borenstein and his colleagues at the University= =20 of California Energy Institute, who \"conservatively\" calculate the=20 overcharges at $4.5 billion; from Paul Joskow, a widely respected energy=20 economist at MIT; and from Edward Kahn, an economic analyst in San Francisc= o.=20 In a recent paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research,=20 Joskow and Kahn conclude that there's \"considerable evidence that the high= =20 prices experienced in the summer of 2000 reflect the withholding of supplie= s=20 from the market by suppliers [generators or marketers] exercising market=20 power.\" That those high prices occurred not merely during peak usage but al= so=20 at off-hours, when no one had ever seen a price spike before, makes those= =20 spikes even more curious.=20 There is, in addition, the powerful suspicion that the huge increase in=20 natural gas prices that a subsidiary of El Paso Energy Co., now the largest= =20 gas company on Earth, was charging on the California side of the=20 California-Arizona border wasn't merely the result of an innocent imbalance= =20 between supply and demand.=20 None of that may be illegal. If there's no collusion, there are no violatio= ns=20 of antitrust laws. But it adds plenty of steam to the political argument. I= n=20 the 2000 election cycle alone, energy companies kicked in some $64 million = in=20 political contributions, 75 percent of it to Republicans. At a time when=20 those companies, many of them located in the same Houston neighborhood, are= =20 racking up astronomical profits and when their collective coziness with Bus= h=20 and the Republican Party is a lot more than rhetoric, their vulnerability t= o=20 a vigorous Senate investigation ought to be obvious.=20 The clincher is \"Blackout,\" a \"Frontline\" program that both symbolizes the= =20 shifting emphasis and reinforces it. (The program is scheduled to be aired = at=20 8 p.m. Friday on Sacramento cable Channel 7.) It isn't another recital of= =20 Californians worrying about their electric bills, or about the stupidity of= =20 the state's deregulation scheme or how Davis dithered in addressing the=20 crisis. It is about those generators and marketers in Houston and North=20 Carolina, men (and a few women) who regard themselves as the heroes of the= =20 new energy markets.=20 The piece is reported by Lowell Bergman, who in working for both \"Frontline= \"=20 and the New York Times has already broken major print stories about Duke=20 Power's secret approach to Davis offering unspecified energy refunds in=20 return for an end to state investigations and lawsuits. Bergman also report= ed=20 private conversations between Enron chairman Kenneth Lay, a major Bush=20 supporter, and FERC chairman Curt Hebert regarding the influence that Lay= =20 could exercise with Bush to allow Hebert to keep his chairmanship if Hebert= 's=20 supported certain decisions Enron badly wants.=20 None of these recent events is likely to end Davis' political woes, and the= y=20 may not produce the wholesale rate caps Feinstein wants and that most=20 economists think necessary -- or maybe any significant reduction in the=20 industry's predatory pricing. But they will surely help turn up the heat,= =20 both in Houston and Washington. Six months ago FERC found wholesale prices= =20 were not \"fair and reasonable\" as federal law requires, but did little abou= t=20 them.

Is trading an insider's game?=20 Buying, selling of electricity is a growth business, but some say deck is= =20 stacked against consumers By Craig D. Rose=20 UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20 June 6, 2001=20 While Californians decry deregulation's failure to deliver a competitive=20 market, electricity wholesalers have quietly developed a vast and rapidly= =20 growing business of buying and selling power among themselves.=20 The deals take place on high-tech trading floors in Houston and elsewhere= =20 around the country, as well as on Internet-based trading systems.=20 Some experts say this electricity trading is a key mechanism for raising=20 consumer power prices, yet it's largely unregulated.=20 \"Electricity trading is like buying stock -- when you have ability to chang= e=20 the stock price,\" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economics profess= or=20 and member of the state grid operator's market surveillance group.=20 Energy companies say the buying and selling of contracts to deliver power= =20 provides risk management, allowing plant owners to presell their electricit= y,=20 lock in prices and avoid fluctuations. The rough and tumble of the free=20 market, they add, is the most efficient means of allocating a resource like= =20 electricity.=20 But industry critics say trading is far from a competitive market paradigm.= =20 In their view, it's a means of communication -- a way for energy insiders t= o=20 collude and raise prices under the guise of competition.=20 To be sure, the trading arms of major energy companies have emerged as star= s=20 in an industry where profit surges of 300 percent or 400 percent are not=20 uncommon.=20 The transactions, shrouded in secrecy, can leave ownership of a critical=20 commodity in unknown hands. Consider the case of power generated by AES=20 Corp.'s California plants.=20 In 1998, AES made a bold move. Immediately after purchasing power plants th= at=20 gave it control of 10 percent of the state's electric generating capacity,= =20 the company sold the output from its plants for the next 20 years to Willia= ms=20 Cos.=20 Williams did not sit on this treasure trove of electrons. The Tulsa, Okla.,= =20 company soon sold 80 percent of what it bought.=20 It is difficult to say who owns that power now. Some might be owned by Semp= ra=20 Trading, a sister company of SDG&E. Or some could be owned by Enron Corp.,= =20 the nation's biggest electricity trader.=20 A spokeswoman for Williams conceded that Williams itself may have repurchas= ed=20 some of the electricity it sold earlier. But trading companies closely guar= d=20 their positions.=20 This much can be said with certainty: Electricity that AES sold for less th= an=20 5 cents per kilowatt-hour to Williams changed hands perhaps 10 times in the= =20 wholesale market and emerged at times in recent months with a price tag for= =20 consumers that was 300 percent higher.=20 Williams' trading profits increased by 523 percent in the first quarter thi= s=20 year. Advance sales All this buying and selling creates curious confluences.=20 In their attempt to deflect criticism over high prices, generating companie= s=20 such as Duke Energy -- operator of the South Bay Power Plant in Chula and= =20 others in the state -- frequently note that they sell most of their=20 electricity far in advance. But they acknowledge less often that their=20 trading units may also be buying power, which could boost the company's=20 electricity inventory.=20 Duke was the fourth biggest electricity trader last year and cited its=20 trading activity as a prime contributor to its wholesale business profits,= =20 which soared 324 percent in the first quarter to $348 million.=20 It is a company's power traders who frequently direct plant operators to=20 increase or decrease the generation of power in response to market=20 conditions.=20 Energy companies have little option but to turn to trading for profits. One= =20 of the better kept secrets of electrical deregulation and its promise of=20 competition is that there is remarkably little competition in the productio= n=20 side of the business.=20 For one thing, electricity is a commodity; power from one company is=20 indistinguishable from that generated by others.=20 More important, nearly all modern plants generate power from turbines built= =20 by a handful of manufacturers. The result? Modern plants owned by different= =20 companies produce power at nearly identical cost.=20 \"The cost of power produced by modern plants is all within a mil=20 (one-thousandth of a dollar),\" said Michael Peevey, an adviser to Gov. Gray= =20 Davis and former president of Southern California Edison.=20 So the extraction of profit in the electricity business relies much more on= =20 trading. Traders' profits rise when prices are volatile -- plunging, or eve= n=20 better, rising sharply. Little regulation But despite the obvious temptation to manipulate the market, the burgeoning= =20 electricity trading business has remained largely unregulated.=20 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission does require quarterly filings fro= m=20 energy traders, but these often provide incomplete information, or at least= =20 little that has been of concern to FERC.=20 In fact, although the trading of electricity grew more than a hundredfold= =20 from 1996 to 2000, FERC has taken no major enforcement action against a=20 trader. After the onset of the California crisis last year, FERC has acted= =20 once. That was against Williams, which agreed to pay $8 million without=20 admitting guilt to resolve an allegation that it withheld supply to pump up= =20 prices.=20 FERC's record of enforcement in the area of power trading stands in contras= t=20 to a long list of enforcement actions within other markets taken by the=20 Securities Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission= .=20 FERC has recently added staff to its market oversight operations. But Willi= am=20 Massey, a FERC commissioner, says the agency's effort is still inadequate.= =20 \"Electricity can be flipped, stripped and chopped up,\" Massey said. \"It's a= n=20 extraordinarily complicated market.=20 \"The sophisticated marketers and traders have simply moved past us. We're= =20 kind of horse and buggy in our approach and they're out there in rocket shi= ps=20 flying around ... The problem is that sophisticated traders don't necessari= ly=20 produce reasonable prices. They produce profits.\"=20 Before deregulation, electricity trading was a low-key affair. Regulated=20 utilities dealt power back and forth on a reciprocal basis to fill=20 electricity shortfalls in their control areas. There was little trading for= =20 profit until the mid-1990s, after federal legislation and FERC rulings open= ed=20 the market.=20 Major traders include large energy companies, sister companies of=20 California's major utilities and Wall Street firms. Market volatility In many ways, the trading of power is similar to that of other commodities.= =20 But there are important differences. Because it cannot be stored and its us= e=20 is so fundamental, the price of electricity is the most volatile of all.=20 When supplies are tight, a single supplier can rapidly raise prices to=20 budget-busting levels, as evidenced by Duke Energy's recent admission that = it=20 charged California nearly $4,000 for a megawatt-hour of power, a quantity= =20 that probably sold hours earlier for one-tenth of that sum or less.=20 Wolak, the Stanford economist, and state Sen. Joseph Dunn, D-Garden Grove,= =20 who is investigating the state power market, say trading allows companies t= o=20 collude under the guise of competition. Instead of wringing out lowest cost= s,=20 the wholesale trading market serves to raise prices, they say.=20 \"As I trade to you and you trade to me, we communicate to each other what= =20 price we would like to get,\" said Wolak. \"It's not collusive. It's just=20 communicating price.\"=20 Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, the nation's biggest power trader, said= =20 California's problem is not the result of trading.=20 \"It's a result of shortages,\" Palmer said.=20 Underscoring its emphasis on trading, Enron's new headquarters tower in=20 downtown Houston rises from a six-story block of new trading floors,=20 including expanded space for electricity trading.=20 Enron also pioneered trading in cyberspace and its Enron Online site claims= =20 to be the most active computer-based trading market.=20 The Houston company argues that consumers won't fully benefit from power=20 trading and deregulation until they have greater choice in choosing their= =20 power supplier. And the company says FERC has not done enough to open acces= s=20 to transmission lines, which would allow traders to move power around the= =20 country. To that end, Enron has lobbied hard for President Bush's plan for = a=20 national electricity grid.=20 Palmer says the notion that the price of electricity rises each time it is= =20 traded is mistaken.=20 \"The market is always looking for the real price of a commodity,\" Palmer=20 said.=20 Dunn, the California state senator, says his investigation found a differen= t=20 function for trading. At a time when supply barely meets or falls short of= =20 demand, he noted, companies with electricity to sell have to worry only abo= ut=20 how high to set their price.=20 \"The trader is a pawn in the generator's game to drive up prices,\" said Dun= n.=20 \"Trading develops a level of trust. You, my alleged competitor, will bid in= =20 the same patterns and I will respond not in a competitive pattern but in a= =20 complimentary pattern.\"=20 The state senator said his investigation found evidence that on several day= s,=20 energy companies appeared to test their ability to drive prices up, without= =20 being undercut by competitors.=20 This ability to drive up prices without competitive consequence is a key te= st=20 of market power, the technical term for manipulation or price fixing.=20 But Dunn also conceded that antitrust violations can be hard to prove in=20 court. He suggested that even if the trading behavior falls short of=20 antitrust violations, it remains anti-competitive and devastating for the= =20 California economy.=20 To Harry Trebing, a utility industry expert and professor emeritus at=20 Michigan State University, wholesale electricity trading is reminiscent of= =20 what took place in the 1920s and early '30s. Back then, utility companies= =20 created complex networks of holding companies that traded stock among=20 themselves, driving up prices in the process.=20 Undoing that scheme was a focus of President Franklin Roosevelt's=20 administration. Congress ended up barring national power companies and=20 tightening regulation of utilities, in an effort to counteract their tenden= cy=20 to create markets that work only for insiders.=20 \"The broad goals of trading are the same,\" Trebing said.=20 \"The goal is to maximize profits through raising prices.\"=20 Daily energy costs for state fall in past weeks=20 By Ed Mendel=20 UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20 June 6, 2001=20 SACRAMENTO -- In some of the first good news of the electricity crisis, the= =20 Davis administration said yesterday that the daily cost of power purchased = by=20 the state for utility customers has dropped in recent weeks.=20 The price-drop news comes after an announcement that Californians conserved= =20 more energy than expected last month, 11 percent, and amid Davis=20 administration optimism that the Legislature may finally begin to move on a= =20 plan to keep Southern California Edison out of bankruptcy.=20 The developments, if they turn out to be a trend and not temporary, could b= e=20 among the first signs that Gov. Gray Davis' plan to end the electricity=20 crisis is beginning to work. But the administration isn't saying that.=20 \"We have had a few good days here lately,\" said S. David Freeman, a Davis= =20 power adviser. \"I don't think that I want to project.\"=20 Some power-market watchers began to speculate last month that prices may ha= ve=20 peaked earlier this year. Platts, an energy information service, said=20 yesterday that spot prices for the natural gas used by power plants are=20 falling this month.=20 The governor's press secretary, Steve Maviglio, told reporters yesterday th= at=20 the daily amount spent on power is now \"well below\" $50 million, which was= =20 the average cost earlier this year.=20 A 12-day gap in the most recent notice to the Legislature that another $500= =20 million increment will be spent on power suggests that the daily average=20 during the last two weeks may have dropped down around $42 million.=20 Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the state power purchasing agency, said that= =20 the average cost of power was under $40 million during the first four days = of=20 this month.=20 Maviglio attributed the lower cost to conservation, the phasing in of cheap= er=20 long-term power contracts, fewer power plants off-line for maintenance, and= =20 cooler weather.=20 However, he said, \"The average cost is still way over what we paid last=20 year.\"=20 There was widespread skepticism in late April when the governor's consultan= ts=20 predicted that the $346 per megawatt-hour average paid by the state for=20 non-contracted power from April through June would drop to an average of $1= 95=20 from July through September.=20 \"We are still very comfortable with the projection that Mr. Fichera and=20 company estimated,\" Maviglio said, referring to Joseph Fichera of Saber=20 Partners in New York.=20 During a briefing on May 21, Fichera told reporters that the amount of powe= r=20 that the state would obtain under long-term contracts for May was expected = to=20 be about 43 percent of the total required, the so-called net short.=20 Fichera said contracts already signed were expected to cover 66 percent of= =20 the net short in June, 48 percent in July, and 42 percent in August. He sai= d=20 contracts that had been agreed on in principle could increase those amounts= =20 to 73 percent in June, 67 percent in July, and 60 percent in August.=20 \"We are still on target. There are risks,\" Fichera said yesterday, among th= em=20 extended hot weather and power plant outages. \"No one is popping the=20 champagne corks until Sept. 30.\"=20 The governor's consultants based their forecast of power demand this summer= =20 on an estimate that Californians will reduce their electricity use by 7=20 percent.=20 The 11 percent reduction last month, as compared to May of last year, came= =20 before the sticker shock of rate hikes that begin this month for customers = of=20 Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric. And a $35 million ad campaign urging= =20 conservation has not hit full stride.=20 Maviglio said the administration plans to release some detailed information= =20 on Monday about the roughly $8 billion the state has spent buying power.

Therein lies the dark side of the vice president's brand of populism. The power subsidy proposal was drafted by a Washington energy consultant who is one of Gore's closest advisers on the environment. One of the major beneficiaries of the plan would be a power company notorious for polluting the atmosphere. To close the circle, the company has used the Gore adviser as a paid consultant. In polishing up his energy program, Gore played a variation on his Los Angeles acceptance speech's populistic attack on certain categories of business that have broken no law. This time, the target was the energy industry (\"Big Oil\"), assailed for benefitting from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' manipulation of oil prices. But Gore is no across-the-board enemy of corporate America. He always takes care of friends. While positioning himself as the foe of Big Oil, he emerges as the friend of Big Power. In that category is American Electric Power, based in Columbus, Ohio, and one of the Midwest's biggest supplier of coal-generated power. AEP, sued by the Environmental Protection Agency last year for alleged violation of the Clear Air Act, is widely viewed as a pariah by the environmentalist movement. It is accused of running one of the dirtiest operations to generate power. AEP frequently has paid for advice from environmental advocate Kathleen A. McGinty, who has an unusual resume indeed. As senior legislative assistant for energy and environmental policy to then-Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, she quickly gained a reputation on Capitol Hill as a passionate advocate for global climate control. Gore picked her for Clinton administration posts, enabling her to affect national policy in a major way. In 1993, she was named to head the new White House Office on Environmental Policy. In 1996, she was promoted to head the Council on Environmental Quality and became a leader in trying to sell to America the massively unpopular 1997 Gore-promoted Kyoto Treaty (never considered by the Senate) to slash energy consumption. Last year, McGinty emerged as a consultant with the law and lobbying firm of Troutman Sanders. There, she has been engaged in an interesting balancing act. On the one hand, she advised AEP and the Atlanta-based Southern Co., another power giant. On the other, she moonlighted for Gore in drafting the June 27 energy plan. Since July, she has been working full time for the Democratic National Committee. Gore's plan promises to \"clean up the nation's aging power plants by using market-based enforcement and comprehensive standards to reduce pollution and increase efficiency.\" It offers \"a menu of financial mechanisms\" to \"those power plants and industries that come forward with projects that promise to dramatically reduce climate and health-threatening pollution.\" That means a big subsidy for electric power companies to help them clean up their plants. According to congressional energy sources, AEP would receive millions of dollars to get right environmentally. Gore always has shown ability to reward individual corporate friends while castigating big business as predators. I previously reported that he had supported permission for deep oil and gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, desired only by Occidental Petroleum Corp., the source of much of his family's wealth. But federal help for Occidental and American Power and the potential for conflicts of interest fly beneath the radar in a capital where the hands of neither political party are clean. It is possible for Gore's diluted brand of populism to flourish because it is the way Washington works.", "flagged": 0}

{"id": 111, "content": "The CAISO recently filed Amendment 30, which would provide the CAISO with the authority to engage in forward contracts/purchasing, etc. to meet reliability requirements. This filing is in response to the language in the FERC San Diego Order which suggested that the FERC believes the CAISO should have this authority. Clearly, this raises issues about the role of the CAISO in the forward markets as a policy matter, but FERC is likely to approved this authority anyway. The CAISO Board is addressing this matter as part of its Comprehensive Market Reform Project. The CAISO Board at the September 7 meeting deferred the issues of the 2-day ahead market (as well as the policy matter of the CAISO buying forward) until the October meeting. However, later during Executive Session, the CAISO Board apparently approved Amendment 30. At this point in time, IEP is not planning on responding to Amendment 30. This position is primarily driven by limited funds in the Restructuring/Transmission Task Force account and, given the forces aligned in support, taking this issue up seem problematic.

EMSHWILLER Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL LOS ANGELES -- California may be struggling to keep its lights on, but one thing there is no shortage of is accusations over who is to blame for an electricity crisis that has sent power prices skyrocketing. In recent days, top California officials have stepped up their rhetoric against a handful of merchant power companies, many of them Texas-based, that supply the state with much of its juice. Gov. Gray Davis says companies such as Reliant Energy Inc., of Houston, have engaged in \"unconscionable price-gouging.\" Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission and a Davis appointee, proclaims that a \"cartel\" of electricity producers has created artificial shortages. Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante is backing a bill that would make energy price-fixing a felony, and as a private citizen he is suing several major power producers in Los Angeles state court. Investigations Under Way About half a dozen investigations are being conducted by entities ranging from state legislative committees to the California attorney general's office. So far, these probes -- some of which have been under way for months -- haven't yet yielded either civil or criminal charges. While the energy suppliers are generating \"unconscionable profits,\" the question remains \"whether they are illegal profits,\" says California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, who has offered rewards of as much as hundreds of millions of dollars for information about lawbreaking in the energy business. Mr. Lockyer says he believes his office will eventually file civil charges against suppliers. He would very much like to add criminal counts. \"I would love to personally escort [Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth] Lay to an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says 'Hi my name is Spike, honey,' \" adds Mr. Lockyer. Houston-based Enron is a major energy-trading company. Like other such firms, Enron has denied wrongdoing in the California market. Mark Palmer, Enron's vice president for corporate communications, said Mr. Lockyer's comment about Mr. Lay \" is so counterproductive that it doesn't merit a response.\" Investigators and academics say there is abundant evidence that individual firms have been exercising \"market power.\" This term is used to denote efforts to influence wholesale-electricity prices, such as by withholding supplies. The California Independent System Operator, or ISO, which manages the state's electric transmission grid, estimates that by exercising market power, suppliers may have added about $6.8 billion to the cost of electricity in the state since early last year. A single firm exercising such power isn't necessarily illegal, says Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute. If a company is a large supplier in the state and \"you're not exercising market power, you are not doing your job\" on behalf of shareholders, he says. Mr. Borenstein and others say that there are steps that should be taken against suppliers. They note that under federal power law, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can order refunds for wholesale prices that are above \"just and reasonable\" levels. So far, FERC has tentatively ordered California suppliers to make tens of millions of dollars of such refunds, as part of that agency's ongoing inquiry into the California market. Critics of the suppliers and FERC say the refunds should be in the billions of dollars. The power industry, not surprisingly, says there is nothing to accusations of price manipulation or collusion. Executives point to a botched state-utility-deregulation plan that relies heavily on volatile spot-market purchases. Suppliers note that over the past decade, California didn't build enough new power plants to keep up with demand growth. The allegations of manipulation are \"a lot of sound and fury and they won't produce anything,\" says Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an industry trade group. Investigations Aplenty In the year since California's energy deregulation plan began resulting in higher prices and even blackouts, a flurry of investigations has gotten under way. Here are the main ones: Agency ????Investigation Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ????Whether generators are charging more than \"just and reasonable\" rates as demanded by the Federal Power Act; whether El Paso Corp. used its position as a major natural-gas supplier to the state to illegally drive up the price of fuel used to generate electricity. California Public Utilities Commission and the State Attorney General ????Whether generators and power traders have acted illegally through collusion or other means to artificially inflate electricity prices. PUC and California Independent System Operator ????Whether generation plants were shut down for spurious reasons in order to create supply shortages and, thus, to raise electricity prices. California Electricity Oversight Board ????Whether patterns of bidding and pricing in California's electricity auction indicate collusive or otherwise illegal behavior. Sources: state and federal agencies Power generators also point to sharp increases in some of their costs, particularly natural gas, which is a major power-plant fuel. This rise in natural-gas prices also has set off a flurry of investigations over possible manipulation. One such case, involving El Paso Corp., Houston, is the subject of probes by federal and state officials. El Paso denies any wrongdoing. While power-industry officials say they have been cooperating with the investigations, law-enforcement officials say they have hit some roadblocks. For instance, Mr. Lockyer's office has gone to San Francisco state court to enforce subpoenas against Reliant, Houston-based Dynegy Inc. and Southern Co. and Mirant Corp., both of Atlanta, after the companies resisted turning over certain business documents they deemed confidential. Investigators have zeroed in on the increased frequency with which plants are going out of service for unscheduled outages. At times, several thousand fewer megawatts of capacity are available than a year ago. A thousand megawatts can power about one million homes. 'Forced Outage' Rate Rises Generators say that this increased \"forced outage\" rate shows that tight supplies over the past year have required them to run plants, some of them more than 40 years old, for long periods without routine maintenance. This combination has produced more breakdowns. \"Plants have been running flat out,\" says Tom Williams, a spokesman for Duke Energy Co., Charlotte, N.C., which says that its California power plants produced 50% more electricity in 2000 than in 1999. At the same time, during periods of lower demand, the number of unplanned outages often seems to rise enough to keep supplies tight, says Frank Wolak, a Stanford University professor and chairman of the ISO's market surveillance committee. \"Clearly, something is going on here.\" However, he and others say that it is almost impossible to tell why a particular pipe failed or whether such a failure was a legitimate reason to reduce output. Some of the most intriguing evidence to date about forced outages surfaced in a federal case. FERC officials said an investigation had raised questions about whether two major power companies had taken plants out of service in order to reap higher electricity prices. The charges against AES Corp., Arlington, Va., which owns the plants, and Williams Cos., Tulsa, Okla., which markets their output, asserted that those actions allowed the companies to reap an extra $10.8 million in revenue. In one instance, according to case filings, a Williams employee \"indicated\" to AES officials that his firm wouldn't financially penalize AES for extending an outage at one plant. This conversation, which was voluntarily divulged by Williams, could be an indication of collusion. Williams and AES settled the case without admitting any wrongdoing by paying back $8 million to the ISO and by taking certain other measures. A Williams spokeswoman says the employee who talked to AES was \"counseled not to enter into any conversations of that nature\" in the future. Another issue raised by the FERC case touched on maintenance procedures. According to the filings, AES stopped doing a certain procedure to keep its plant's cooling system from getting clogged. The clogging of the system was cited as a reason for one of the forced outages. Mark Woodruff, president of the AES unit that operates the plant in question, says the company substituted what it felt was an equally effective maintenance procedure. If someone was looking to keep supplies tight and prices high, changes in maintenance procedures would be an easy way to ensure that plants, particularly old ones, have frequent forced outages, says a senior utility-industry executive. By restricting maintenance resources, he says, an operator can simply allow a plant \"to take itself out of service.\" Write to John R.

Now California has power watches and power warnings to guide residents through days of summer blackouts. ??Beginning next week, forecasters who look at variables like electricity loads and transmission constraints instead of wind speeds and barometric pressure will lay the odds of blackouts being imposed the next day. If those odds appear to be 50-50 or greater, they will issue a power warning. ??In addition, the California Independent System Operator will issue 30-minute advisories to warn state residents that blackouts are probably imminent. ??The new warnings are in response to complaints that blackouts have taken people by surprise. ??\"What we're hearing from the public is they wanted a little more heads-up when it comes to blackouts,\" said ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle. ??Meanwhile, Gov. Gray Davis was in Chicago Monday to hear firsthand from city officials about how an advance notification program can work. State lawmakers are exploring ways to provide Californians with greater notice of potential blackouts, including scheduling them in advance. ??In Chicago, where aging lines and structural limitations have produced a string of power outages over the past two summers, residents often receive 30 minutes warning a blackout is coming, and grid operators work with city agencies and police to ensure criminals don't take advantage of the opportunity. ??California's new warning system has considerable limits. ??The ISO, after all, does not determine where blackouts occur. They simply tell the three utilities in the system _ Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric _ when to shut off power and how much to turn off. ??It is up to the utilities to determine where the blackouts occur. ??PG&E's website posts which of 14 outage blocks is next to be hit, so anyone who knows their block number could use information from PG&E and the ISO websites to prepare for a blackout. ??PG&E spokesman John Nelson said the Northern California utility can make tens of thousands of phone calls to businesses and customers who need power for life-support systems and other medical necessities \"in a very short period of time.\" ??\"We think that anything that increases the amount of time that we're given by the ISO . . . is a good thing,\" Nelson said, adding that at the beginning of this year the utility was assuming that it would get about 30 minutes notice before blackouts were ordered. ??In another development on Monday, state Controller Kathleen Connell issued another warning about the financial toll California's energy crisis is taking on the state treasury. Connell said the state could run out of cash by Sept. 1 if $ 13.4 billion in revenue bonds aren't sold. ??The state plans to sell the bonds in late August to cover the cost of buying electricity needed by financially troubled Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison to serve their customers. ??Even if the bonds go through without a hitch, Connell said the state will have to seek more bonds or borrow between $3 billion and $5 billion beginning February 2002 to continue buying power. She said electricity purchases are costing the state more than the governor anticipated and far less has been bought through long-term contracts than Davis planned. ??But the governor's top energy aides challenged Connell's analysis and said they believe long-term contracts now being put in place combined with conservation efforts will bring spending down. Joe Fichera, a Davis financial adviser, said the state spent $1.8 billion to buy power in April, only 1.4 percent higher than the $1.78 billion estimated. ??\"I think reasonable people can differ in terms of the projections,\" Fichera said. \"I don't know what's underlying all of her assumptions and such. We do have more complete information . . . .\" ??To highlight the exorbitant costs of power, Connell pointed to an enlarged picture of a $533 million check the state sent the Mirant Corp. for April power purchases. ??Mirant defended its sales. Included in its April sales were $126 million worth of electricity that the company bought from companies unwilling to sell to California but which Mirant purchased and then sold to California at a 12 percent markup, according to figures released by the company. ??\"If the intent was to somehow attack Mirant for its role in the California market in April, then I'd have to say that the state has apparently decided to bite a helping hand,\" said Randy Harrison, CEO of Mirant's western U.S. operations. ??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune ??(c) 2001, Contra Costa Times (Walnut Creek, Calif.). ??Visit the Contra Costa Times on the Web at http://www.cctimes.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: CC LOAD-DATE: May 22, 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS 2001 Copley News Service News Service 22, 2001, Tuesday SECTION: State and regional LENGTH: 1066 words HEADLINE: State sends $533.2 million to company, part of April bill BYLINE: Ed Mendel DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??One of the biggest single checks ever issued by the state of California, $533.2 million, went to an Atlanta-based firm Friday for power purchased for California utility customers during a single month, April. ??Mirant, formerly Southern Energy, says more than half of the power came from three plants in the San Francisco Bay Area that it purchased from Pacific Gas and Electric for $801 million under a failed deregulation plan. ??State Treasurer Kathleen Connell, who displayed a blown-up copy of the check at a news conference yesterday, said she thinks the state has failed to obtain enough cheap long-term power contracts and will have to borrow more than the $13.4 billion planned. ??Connell, an elected official who issues state checks, said the power bills she had paid by last Thursday, totaling $5.1 billion, provide no basis for assuming that the price of electricity ''is dropping and that it will continue to drop through the summer.'' ??But a consultant for Gov. Gray Davis said the state, which has more long-term contracts than Connell has seen, is on track to control power costs with the aid of conservation and that it plans to meet its goals without additional borrowing. ??''I think the public should have confidence that this is not a rosy scenario,'' said Joseph Fichera of Saber Partners, a Davis consultant. ''It's the expected scenario.'' ??The state plans to issue a bond of up to $13.4 billion in late August that will repay the general-fund taxpayer money used for power purchases, about $7 billion so far. The bond will be paid off over 15 years by utility customers. ??Davis has declined to reveal details of state spending for power, arguing that the information would be used by power suppliers to submit higher bids. A group of newspapers and Republican legislators have filed lawsuits to force disclosure. ??Connell said she has received 25 contracts from 17 power suppliers. She declined to release details of the contracts, saying they are complicated and have varying prices. ??Connell said the check for $533,181,235 issued to Mirant Friday is one of the largest she has written since taking office in 1995. ??''This purchase was made entirely at spot-market prices,'' Connell said, ''even though the Department of Water Resources (the state agency that purchases power) has an executed long-term contract with this company.'' ??Mirant said in a statement that, at the request of the state, its marketing arm gave the state a ''helping hand'' by buying power from suppliers not willing to sell to the state and then reselling the power to the state. ??''We've done the state a tremendous service in purchasing power on its behalf,'' said Randy Harrison, Mirant's Western chief executive officer, ''and it's wrong for the transactions to be misinterpreted and skewed in a negative light.'' ??Mirant said its subsidiaries generated 1.377 million megawatt-hours in April, while its marketing arm purchased enough additional electricity to boost the total sold to the state during the month to 2.077 million megawatt-hours. ??The firm said the power was sold for an average of $256.87 per megawatt-hour. That's below the $346 average that the state expects to pay on the expensive spot market during the second quarter of this year, from April through June. ??But it's well above the average price of $69 per megawatt-hour said to have been obtained in the first round of long-term contracts negotiated by the state. ??Mirant purchased three power plants from PG&E capable of producing 3,000 megawatts during a controversial part of deregulation. The state Public Utilities Commission ordered utilities to sell off at least half of their fossil-fuel power plants without requiring the purchasers to provide low-cost power to California. ??The utilities sold nearly two dozen major power plants capable of producing more than 20,000 megawatts. The largest group of plants, 4,700 megawatts, went to AES Corp. of Virginia. Three Texas firms purchased plants producing 7,000 megawatts. ??The power supply situation in California remained sound enough yesterday to ward off blackouts, although temperatures are on the rise throughout the state. More heat means more air conditioning, and a greater strain on the system. ??But starting next month, the state's electricity grid managers plan to provide businesses and consumers with better forecasts of potential rolling blackouts. ??The California Independent System Operator will post on its Web site ''power warnings'' when there is at least a 50 percent chance that rolling blackouts might be required during the next 24 hours. The ISO will issue a ''power watch'' when less-critical shortages are anticipated in advance of high demand days. ??The agency also plans to give a 30-minute warning before it orders utilities to cut power to customers, posting information about probable interruptions on its Web site. Its Web site address is www.caiso.com. ??''There have been a number of requests from businesses and consumers alike that would like more advance notice and to be able to plan better. That's what we are trying to do,'' ISO spokeswoman Lorie O'Donley said. ??O'Donley said many details about how notifications will occur still have to be worked out, including whether e-mails or pagers might be used. ??In other developments in the electricity crisis: ???About 1.5 million compact fluorescent light bulbs will be distributed to 375,000 households as part of the ''Power Walk'' program that began during the weekend. Members of the California Conservation Corps are going door-to-door in parts of some cities to distribute the bulbs as part of a $20 million conservation program. ???Republican legislative leaders sent Davis a letter criticizing the governor for using taxpayer funds to hire two aides to former Vice President Al Gore as communication consultants for $30,000 a month. The Republicans said Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane operate ''a partisan, cut-throat political communications firm.'' ???The state auditor general said in a report on energy deregulation that the state is not meeting some of its goals for conservation and for building new power plants. The auditor also said the PUC does not have a process for quickly approving new transmission lines. The state has been importing about 20 percent of its power.

Rose DATELINE: SAN DIEGO BODY: ??San Dieg Gas and Electric's commercial customers are attacking the prospect of paying an average of 29 percent more to cover the state's soaring cost of buying electricity. ??At a California Public Utilities Commission hearing in San Diego yesterday, some business customers also noted the irony that only in February did they win the same rate freeze as residential customers. ??''We need rates we can depend on,'' said John Roberts, who owns an irrigation products business in San Marcos. ??SDG&E customers were the first to bear the brunt of deregulation, and the utility's residential ratepayers were the first to win a reprieve when the state passed a 6.5-cent per kilowatt hour cap. ??The SDG&E cap is expected to end for all customers in the coming weeks as the commission moves to increase SDG&E's rates to levels now paid by customers of PG&E and Edison, which are about 3 cents per kilowatt hour higher. ??Yesterday's hearing, however, was for commercial rates. ??Roberts said his San Marcos-based irrigation products company has withstood a tripling of power costs over the past year, while having to cut the cost of its products because of competition, he said. ??Roberts added that socking businesses with high costs in order to spare residential electricity customers from expected rate hikes could be counterproductive. ??''If businesses leave the state, they'll be without jobs, and a $30 savings on their power bills won't mean much,'' Roberts said. ??The hearing at the County Administration Building was attended by about 30 people. An additional hearing is scheduled at 7 p.m. today in the Community Rooms at the Oceanside Civic Center, 330 N. Coast Highway. ??Larger crowds are expected for hearings on residential rate increases.

Gray Davis has one major political goal: running for president of the United States. His recent hiring of two--not one--political aides, to be paid for by the taxpayers at a monthly rate more than double the salary of the governor, means that Davis has decided that the California taxpayer will pay through the nose to support this goal. ??These consultants are not experts in the energy area, which is the biggest problem facing California today, but are experienced spin doctors brought in to try to improve the diving image of Davis. I have no problem with the governor bringing in these men at his own expense, but for the taxpayer to foot the bill is bordering on criminal. ??Jack Bendar ???o7 Pacific Palisades ???f7 * ??Is anyone as outraged as I am over Davis hiring, at California taxpayers' expense, damage-control experts to cover his lack of energy policy leadership? The fee of $30,000 per month is outrageous and is an insult to citizens.

Davis has the power generating companies. But, as Pogo said, \"We have met the enemy, and he is us.\" If Davis and his cronies in the Legislature had the courage to allow retail electricity prices to rise, businesses and individuals would have a financial incentive to conserve. ??If Davis and his cronies had had the wisdom to foresee the huge capacity shortfall looming, perhaps California wouldn't have wasted the last decade without bringing even one new power plant online.

BYLINE: DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Republican legislative leaders Monday blasted Gov. Gray Davis' decision to spend $30,000 a month in taxpayer money to retain communications consultants known for their highly partisan work. ??Labeling consultants Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane as \"cut-throat,\" Senate GOP leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga and Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks said in a letter to Davis that the hiring \"undermines the assertions you have made both publicly and privately throughout this crisis.\" ??Davis announced Friday that he retained the duo and that the state will pay them a combined $30,000 a month for at least the next six months. ??\"We're not going to support the hiring of political hacks on government payroll,\" Brulte said in an interview. \"Lehane and Fabiani are very talented. The issue is which payroll is appropriate. . . . These are political opposition research attack dogs. If the governor wants them, he ought to pay for them with his $30-million political war chest.\" ??Some consumer advocates also criticized the move, citing the consultants' work on behalf of Southern California Edison. In their private consulting business, Fabiani and Lehane are working to win over public and political support for Davis' $3.5-billion plan to rescue Edison from its financial difficulties. Legislation embodying aspects of the deal is pending in Sacramento. ??On Monday, Brulte and Cox also complained about the consultants' dual role. ??\"California taxpayers should not be asked to finance political consultants or individuals who have a vested business interest with the state,\" the letter said. ??Fabiani and Lehane had worked in the Clinton administration, and in Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign, where they gained a reputation as attack-oriented operatives. Lehane on Monday defended the governor's decision to use tax money to pay their fees, saying government often hires outside experts and that he and Fabiani will \"serve as communications advisors to help the governor fight against these generators.\" ??\"The Republicans,\" Lehane added, \"ought to be spending time writing letters to George W. Bush to get him to stop the Texas generators from gouging California. . . . That is the real issue here.\" ??Davis, meanwhile, returned to California on Monday after a weekend of fund-raisers. He was in Texas on Saturday for a Dallas event that had been scheduled for April 11. It was postponed when Pacific Gas & Electric filed for bankruptcy protection. ??\"There is a very large fund-raising base for Democrats in Texas,\" Davis' campaign strategist, Garry South, said of the state that is home to some of the generators that Davis has criticized. ??Davis traveled to Chicago for another fund-raiser Sunday, then met Monday with city officials to discuss how Chicago deals with electrical blackouts. ??After blackouts crippled downtown Chicago in the summer of 1999, Mayor Richard M. Daley demanded that the city's electricity provider, Commonwealth Edison, give advance notice of power cuts. Customers now sometimes receive warnings two or three days in advance. ??Davis emerged from the meeting saying \"the utilities have got to tell us in advance when they're going to have a planned blackout.\" ??It was not, however, readily apparent how Chicago's solutions would translate to California, because its electrical problems are vastly different. Rather than suffering a shortage of electricity throughout the grid like California, Chicago has the more microcosmic ills of an aging system--an obsolete transformer going down, for example, leaving several city blocks in the dark until workers can fix it. ??* ??Times staff writer Eric Slater contributed to this story.

BYLINE: DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Legislative Democrats today will sue federal energy regulators, charging that their inaction threatens elderly people in nursing homes, children in day care centers, law enforcement and its ability to fight crime, and the state's drinking water supplies. ??Rather than focus on record wholesale energy costs, the lawsuit takes a new tack, homing in on the threat to health and safety posed by California's energy crisis and the blackouts likely this summer. ??A draft of the suit seeks to force the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to set \"just and reasonable\" wholesale power rates as a way of ending the crisis before blackouts occur. The action is being filed by veteran trial attorney Joe Cotchett on behalf of Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco), Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks), and the city of Oakland. ??\"A crisis of unprecedented dimensions is already taking shape in California,\" the draft says. \"The public health, safety and welfare of the state's 34 million residents is in jeopardy due to the tragic consequences of rolling blackouts and punitive prices.\" ??Suit Says Blackouts Pose Threats ??Until now, most California officials, including Gov. Gray Davis, have been urging that the regulatory commission cap wholesale power prices as a way of limiting costs to the state, which has spent more than $6 billion buying electricity since January. ??In the lawsuit, Cotchett will be arguing that while higher bills will stretch the budgets of people on fixed incomes, frail elderly people \"are left to wonder if their oxygen tanks, drip IVs, dialysis machines and electricity-powered therapeutic beds will respond when they are needed.\" ??\"Rolling blackouts represent more than just an annoyance for the men, women and children with disabilities,\" the suit says. \"They represent an imminent threat to life, health and independence.\" ??Cotchett said the suit will be filed in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, bypassing the federal trial court. Cotchett said the circuit court has direct jurisdiction over FERC. ??Joining Cotchett will be Clark Kelso, a professor at McGeorge Law School in Sacramento who briefly was insurance commissioner last year after Chuck Quackenbush resigned. Kelso said he initially was skeptical that lawmakers had legal standing to sue. But after Cotchett spoke with him, Kelso said he became convinced the suit had merit. ??\"Let's face it,\" said Kelso, a Republican, \"this is the single most important issue that the state faces for the next six months.\" ??Watching the Water Supply ??The suit cites warnings from governmental agencies about the implications of blackouts, including one the state Department of Health Services issued earlier this month to public water agencies statewide. The warning contains a sample notice that local water authorities should give to consumers. ??\"If the water looks cloudy or dirty,\" the warning says, \"you should not drink it.\" The warning suggests that if people are concerned about water quality, they can boil it or add \"eight drops of household bleach to one gallon of water, and let it sit for 30 minutes.\" ??Most water agencies have back-up generators. But the suit says that \"if an agency's water treatment facilities are hit by a power outage, a two-hour blackout can result in two-day interruptions in providing safe drinking water because of time needed to bring equipment back online and flush potentially contaminated water from the system.\" LOAD-DATE: May 22, 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS 2001 / Los Angeles Times Angeles Times ??????????????????????May 22, 2001 Tuesday ?Home Edition SECTION: California; Part 2; Page 1; Metro Desk LENGTH: 892 words HEADLINE: State to Issue Warnings of Power Outages; Electricity: Cal-ISO says it will try to give residents and businesses 24-hour notice of probable blackouts. BYLINE: MIGUEL BUSTILLO, NANCY VOGEL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Californians will hear an expanded forecast on their morning commutes this summer, courtesy of the energy crisis: \"The 405 Freeway is jammed, there's a slim chance of showers, and oh, by the way, there's a 50% likelihood of blackouts.\" ??By the end of this month, the California Independent System Operator, the agency that manages the state's power grid, expects to issue 24-hour forecasts generally detailing when and where blackouts can be expected. ??It is also piecing together a high-tech system to give businesses, government officials and the public at least a half-hour notice of a probable blackout in their area. ??Just how those notices will be issued remains somewhat up in the air, but Cal-ISO is talking with private companies capable of notifying more than 10,000 customers a minute via fax and phone, and millions a minute via wireless communications such as pagers. ??Cal-ISO assembled the plan after complaints from businesses, particularly those in the Silicon Valley, that last-minute blackouts were costing California millions. The plan also responds to growing political pressure for the public to be kept informed of the barrage of outages that is expected to darken the state this summer because of insufficient supplies of electricity. ??If Californians' electricity use pattern is similar to last year's, Cal-ISO has projected, the state could suffer 34 days of blackouts, making increased notification crucial. ??With a shortage of hydroelectric power imports from the drought-stricken Pacific Northwest, and no new power plants coming online until July, the agency calculates that there will be a supply-demand gap in June of 3,700 megawatts--enough power to supply 2.8 million homes. A national utility industry group painted a more dire scenario last week when it predicted that California will experience up to 260 hours of blackouts this summer. ??\"The weather report and traffic report are good analogies; people know they are not 100% accurate, but if [a blackout] really means a lot to them, they will check in,\" said Mike Florio of the Utility Reform Network, who serves on the Cal-ISO board. ??Details remain sketchy, and the programs may be altered when the board meets Thursday. But a Web page called \"Today's Outlook\" on the agency's Internet site, http://www.caiso.com, will be created to illustrate, hour by hour, how much electricity is available during a 24-hour period and whether there is a predicted surplus or shortfall. ??Media outreach will be expanded to provide news bulletins on electricity conditions a day in advance. They will not only include demand projections and the effects of weather, but they also will define the level of emergency that is expected. ??A \"power watch\" will be sounded during stage 1 and stage 2 shortages, and a more serious \"power warning\" if there is a 50-50 chance of a stage 3, which often results in blackouts. (Stage 1 emergencies occur when power reserves drop below 7%, stage 2 5% and stage 3 1.5%.) ??Most important, Cal-ISO is pledging to provide 30-minute notice of probable blackouts to people in the areas served by Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric, among others. In addition to giving the warnings on the Internet and through the mass media, Cal-ISO will sound alarms to select e-mail addresses and pager numbers on \"blast lists,\" or massive computer databases that it will assemble. ??\"The technology is there. This is a war California is in, and we should be deploying high-tech solutions,\" said Carl Guardino of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group, the Cal-ISO board member who had been pushing hardest for better notification. \"Every time California goes black, the economy sees red.\" ??Guardino said that businesses and public agencies are now receiving just two- to six-minute warnings before blackouts, not nearly enough to react. ??\"A two-minute warning may be sufficient in a football game, but it is insufficient to protect California businesses and the public,\" he said. ??Though businesses and government agencies are expected to make the most of the warnings, Florio said residents also will benefit. ??\"It will be more of a challenge to get the information to individual homeowners, but if someone works at home, and sets it up to get an e-mail notice, they can take advantage,\" he said. ??In other energy news Monday, the woman in charge of paying California's power bills warned that a $13.4-billion bond issue to cover electricity purchases will be insufficient and that the state will have to borrow $4 billion more before it runs out of cash in February. ??Calling a news conference in the capital, state Controller Kathleen Connell questioned the key assumptions underpinning Gov. Gray Davis' financial plan for overcoming the energy crisis. The plan assumes the $13.4 billion in bond sales will repay state coffers for electricity purchases and cover future power buys for the next two years. ??Connell's opinion is notable because, as the state's chief check writer, the independently elected Democrat is privy to information about the prices the state is paying for electricity bought on the spot market and through long-term contracts--data that Davis has largely kept secret. ??Davis' advisors and Department of Finance officials dispute Connell's warnings.

Long commutes. Mediocre schools. Housing costs. At the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area, the Valley's answer to Central Park, such ordinary concerns about money, time and resources stretched too thin for comfort tumbled out again and again during interviews with some two dozen people visiting this green oasis. ??Sprawling northwest from the tangled junction of the San Diego and Ventura freeways, the recreation area is a pastoral patchwork of three golf courses bracketed by Woodley Avenue Park to the east and Lake Balboa to the west. It hardly looks like a battleground, but the 2,000-acre park straddles something of a political fault line in the mayoral contest. ??Both candidates in the June 5 runoff, former state legislator Antonio Villaraigosa and City Atty. James K. Hahn, have staked out the Valley as prime campaign turf, packed with thousands of up-for-grabs voters whose affections might well tip the race. ??And the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area is wedged between an electoral no man's land--a southern ribbon of the Valley where about 60% of voters shunned both men in the election's first round--and a central Valley region where Villaraigosa took first place in April, beating Hahn by roughly a 2-to-1 margin. ??Between them, the candidates are expected to spend more than $10 million by election day to get their messages out. But it's not clear whether these impassioned appeals are reaching their intended targets. ??Less than a month before the election, many people here are preoccupied with concerns that have little to do with City Hall. And when they do voice interest in local matters, some seem unable to connect these issues to a candidate. ??For instance, several Valley voters interviewed in the park in early May said that knotted traffic on the San Diego Freeway was a major problem. But no one mentioned a plan Villaraigosa unveiled in March to buy hundreds of new buses and slash fares in a sweeping bid to cut vehicle traffic, or a proposal from Hahn to add more carpool lanes on freeways. ??Which raises a fundamental challenge for would-be mayors: Sometimes, there's just too much going on in everyday life to tune in to city politics. \"I know I ought to,\" many people confess sheepishly, \"but I just haven't gotten around to it yet.\" ??Take Randye Sandel, 58, a blond and bespectacled oil painter from Valley Village. Sandel said she plans to vote for Hahn, \"a known quantity\" in City Hall, but a moment later admits that she might change her mind. The thing is, Sandel adds, she's been really busy setting up an art exhibition at a Santa Monica gallery and has yet to research her mayoral options. \"I've been totally immersed in my own life,\" she said. ??Same goes for Harold Seay, a muscular golfer heading back to his car after playing 18 holes. The 44-year-old music teacher from Encino said he's had his hands full for weeks rehearsing graduation recitals for a Brentwood private school. \"The news is the last thing I'm paying attention to,\" he said. ??But both voters can easily rattle off their most pressing concerns. Sandel, who used to teach art at Valley College, said she is particularly worried about education. ??\"The last few semesters I taught, I was horrified by the academic preparedness of the students. They were practically illiterate,\" she said. \"They couldn't take notes from my lecture because they didn't understand the vocabulary. That bothers me a lot. Who's going to inherit this country?\" ??Seay, who recently moved to Los Angeles from Miami, said he is troubled by the air pollution and racial tension he has encountered here. Seay is African American and his wife is Italian, he said, and their 9-year-old daughter is \"stuck half-and-half,\" caught in what Seay regards as a troubling black-white divide. \"That black-white thing really turns me off,\" he said. \"I care about people getting along.\" ??As the mayoral race hurtles into its final weeks, some of Hahn and Villaraigosa's most spirited skirmishes have erupted over crime and law enforcement issues. Each man is trying to burnish his own crime-fighting credentials while accusing his rival of neglecting public safety. ??The candidates have squabbled especially fiercely over compressed work schedules for police officers--the notion of squashing the police workweek into three 12-hour days, or possibly four 10-hour days. The Police Protective League endorsed Hahn, who supports the so-called 3-12 schedule favored by the union. Villaraigosa, whom Hahn has often characterized as soft on crime, seized upon the scheduling issue to retaliate, arguing that the three-day week would jeopardize public safety. ??But interviews with people visiting the Valley's biggest park revealed that crime--which has declined significantly since Mayor Richard Riordan took office eight years ago--was not the main issue weighing on these voters' minds. That distinction belongs to something that has walloped wallets far and wide across this car-addled city: the soaring price of gasoline. ??As he cooled down after a six-mile run near Balboa Lake, Ray Verdugo summed up the problem facing many gas-guzzlers as prices approached $2 a gallon: \"I made a big mistake and bought a big SUV,\" lamented the retired Rocketdyne engineer from Winnetka. \"I'm on a fixed income, and [gasoline prices] keep going up all the time.\" ??Big-city mayors, to be sure, wield minimal influence over gasoline pumps. Gas prices are swayed by market forces, including the international cost of crude oil, rising demand and limited refinery capacity. Nonetheless, about a third of voters interviewed as they ambled around the Sepulveda Basin named gas prices as a top concern. Half as many said they were worried about crime. ??Some voters said they were troubled by California's electricity woes, although Los Angeles residents have been spared shortages and blackouts because the city's municipal utility avoided deregulation. ??\"I think building more power plants would help,\" said Julie Erickson, 27, a figure-skating instructor from Reseda. ??And then there are the things that people aren't talking about. Nobody (at least nobody in an admittedly unscientific sample of voters culled over two days in the Sepulveda Basin) mentioned the Rampart police scandal or the recruiting problems crippling the Los Angeles Police Department. ??No one uttered so much as a peep about neighborhood councils, that much-ballyhooed innovation of the new city charter. Even the Valley secession movement--which Villaraigosa has pointed to as \"the biggest challenge facing Los Angeles\"--hardly earned an honorable mention from this cross-section of Valleyites. Only one voter referred to secession at all, saying that she favored it. ??Instead, many people voiced personal gripes, the kind of woes unlikely to vault to the center of the mayoral radar screen--but issues that nonetheless embody the high quality of life both candidates envision for Los Angeles. ??One man, a sunburned golfer who lives in Van Nuys, said he's dismayed that the city hasn't finished building a new golf clubhouse and restaurant at the Woodley Lakes Golf Course. Another frequent park visitor, a retired housekeeper from Sherman Oaks, complained about the windblown litter she sees as she walks her dog around Balboa Lake. ??But some problems vexing these voters seem frankly beyond the grasp of even the most poll-tested candidate. ??Sandel, the oil painter, got downright metaphysical after a good 15 minutes spent mulling the troubles facing Los Angeles, and indeed the world. Technology, she concluded, was advancing so rapidly that it was crowding out humanity's intuitive, spiritual side. ??\"I think there's an extraordinary sense of collective despair and psychological uncertainty smoldering just below the surface,\" she said. \"I don't know what City Hall can do about that.\" GRAPHIC: PHOTO: Ray Verdugo, a retired Rocketdyne engineer, says, \"I'm on a fixed income, and [gas prices] keep going up all the time.\" PHOTOGRAPHER: BORIS YARO / Los Angeles Times GRAPHIC-MAP: (no caption), Los Angeles Times LOAD-DATE: May 22, 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS 2001 Newsday, Inc.

The agency also promised to give 30 minutes' warning before it orders utility companies to pull the plug on homes and businesses, a move that could prevent traffic accidents, stuck elevators and costly shutdowns at factories. ??Up to now, the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning, saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. The utility companies also have resisted giving warnings, saying they did not want to tip off burglars and other criminals. ??\"People are asking for additional notice, so we're doing our best to make that a reality,\" said Lorie O'Donley, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator. ??The state's power system, crippled by a botched effort at deregulation, has been unable to produce or buy enough electricity to power air conditioners on hot days. The rolling blackouts move from neighborhood to neighborhood in a sequence that is determined by the utility companies and is difficult for the public to predict. The outages last 60 to 90 minutes and then skip to another neighborhood. ??Because of the lack of notice, the six days of rolling blackouts so far this year have led to pileups at intersections suddenly left without stoplights, people trapped in elevators, and losses caused by stopped production lines. People with home medical equipment fret that they will be cut off without warning. ??The new plan borrows from the language of weather forecasters: Beginning May 30 the ISO will issue a \"power watch\" or \"power warning\" that will give notice the grid could be headed toward blackouts. It will issue a 30-minute warning to the media and others before any blackouts begin but will not say what neighborhoods will be hit. ??\"Any time is better than none,\" said Bill Dombrowski, president of the California Retailers Association. \"Obviously, we'd like more, but we're realistic about what they can do.\" LOAD-DATE: May 22, 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS ?????????????????Copyright 2001 The Chronicle Publishing Co. ?????????????????????????The San Francisco Chronicle ?????????????????????MAY 22, 2001, TUESDAY, FINAL EDITION SECTION: NEWS; Pg.

Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana (Orange County), who heads a special committee reviewing energy prices, called the \"ramping\" allegations, first disclosed in The Chronicle on Sunday, \"outrageous acts of manipulation.\" ???Dunn said that even if the practices did not violate current law, legislation could be drafted to make such acts illegal in the future. ???\"We're looking at it, yes, from the point of view of civil or criminal statutes that may exist but also whether legislation should be introduced to render it a violation for future such acts.\" ???Dunn's committee already has been investigating charges that power generators \"gamed\" the wholesale energy market to boost their profits. ???The Chronicle reported Sunday that power companies used a complex tactic to alter the output of their plants, sometimes several times within an hour. ???Sources who work in the plants said the ploy enabled the companies to drive up the prices they receive for electricity. The firms avoided detection by still meeting the terms of their contracts, which required them to supply a certain amount of power each hour. The sources said the tactic greatly contributed to deteriorating physical conditions at the plants, leading to the record level of outages now plaguing California plants. ???The senate committee, which convened in March after The Chronicle reported that power companies had overstated the growth in demand for electricity in California, has obtained confidential bidding and generation data for power-generating companies. Dunn said the data will be analyzed to determine which plants employed the ramping tactic. He added that the issue would be examined in a public hearing in the coming weeks. ???Meanwhile, pressure continued to mount on generating companies that drove electricity supplies through the roof during the past year. ???Sources said the California Public Utilities Commission, which is investigating allegedly unnecessary plant shutdowns, has narrowed its focus. It is targeting several plants that had no apparent defects yet went offline during periods when prices were rising because of limited electricity supplies. ???Commissioner Jeff Brown said the names of these plants are under court seal. However, Dow Jones reported yesterday that one of them was a San Diego-area plant co-owned by Dynegy Inc. of Houston and NRG Inc. of Minneapolis. Another was a Pittsburg plant owned by Mirant Corp. of Atlanta. The companies denied the allegations. ???On another front, Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, and Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks (Los Angeles County), were expected to file a lawsuit this morning against the Federal Energy Regulatory Committee for failing to carry out its stated duty of ensuring \"just and reasonable\" electricity rates. ???\"Their central failing is that they don't follow the law,\" Burton said in an interview. \"Either they're letting their friends within the industry or their ideology get in the way of their public responsibility.\" ???The California attorney general's office also is pressing forward with an investigation into the practices of wholesale power companies.

Two minutes may be fine in a football game, but it's not fine for California's economy or safety.\" ???ISO officials also said they are examining high-tech ways of quickly spreading the word about impending blackouts to homeowners and businesses through mass e-mails, faxes, automated phone calls and pager messages. ???The plan, detailed in a report issued yesterday, still falls far short of other proposals being pushed in the Legislature. Lawmakers have suggested scheduling blackout days months in advance and having California join with other Western states to form a \"buyer's cartel\" that would refuse to pay for power when prices become too high. ???\"It's not the report I was expecting, but 30 minutes of notice is certainly better than two,\" said Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Ray. \"No matter how you slice it, this summer is going to be miserable. The question is whether we want to have planned misery or unplanned misery.\" ???A spokesman for the California Manufacturers and Technology Association, which commissioned a recent report that found unplanned blackouts could cost the state economy $21.8 billion, said the ISO policy changes will be a tremendous help to many businesses. ???\"In this electrically unreliable world, any notification manufacturers can get is good,\" said Gino DeCaro, a spokesman for the association. \"While 30 minutes won't be enough for some, for most manufacturers it will be sufficient.\" The ISO will wait for guidance from the governor and lawmakers regarding more complicated issues such as the creation of scheduled blackouts, said Michael Florio, an ISO board member and official at The Utility Reform Network. ???\"There are bigger public policy ramifications,\" Florio said. ???The ideas will be discussed in greater detail at an ISO board meeting Thursday. Stephanie McCorkle, an ISO spokeswoman, said the changes are just updates of policies already in place. ???WARNING OF 'PROBABLE' BLACKOUTS ???The 30-minute advance-notification system, scheduled to go into effect early next month, would warn of \"probable\" blackouts, including the amount of load that will have to be curtailed in each service area. ???Until now, the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning, saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. The utilities also have resisted giving warnings, saying they did not want to tip off burglars and other criminals. ???The ISO also has been working to upgrade its Web site to provide the most current information about how much electricity is being used and how much is available. It will also establish a system this summer through which that information can be sent in an hourly e-mail. ???This information may make it easier for larger users of electricity to plan their operations, said ISO spokeswoman Lorie O'Donley. ???Also planned by the ISO is a \"Power Watch/Power Warning\" system that would provide a 24-hour notice of high-demand days. ???Under the two-tiered system, a \"Power Watch\" would be declared whenever a Stage One or Stage Two alert is likely, while a \"Power Warning\" would be issued whenever there is at least a 50 percent chance of a Stage Three alert. ???With one report suggesting California may see as many as 700 hours of rolling blackouts this summer, lawmakers are hard at work trying to find ways to make the outages easier for power customers to cope with. ???The idea of a buyer's cartel, the subject of a Capitol hearing today, would have California -- in partnership with other states -- set a firm ceiling on what it will pay power producers for electricity this summer -- and not one dime more. ???The idea, which has attracted the support of some key lawmakers and the cautious interest of Gov. Gray Davis, could potentially curtail the exorbitantly high prices the state has been paying for electricity. ???The trade-off would be the likelihood of more frequent blackouts than if the state continues to pay any price electricity sellers demand. ???The maximum the state would pay would be set by a formula, based on such things as the cost of natural gas. A reasonable profit for power producers would be built in, supporters said. ???DESIGNATING BLACKOUT DAYS ???Meanwhile, Assemblyman Mike Briggs, R-Fresno, will introduce a bill today that would require the state's utilities and Public Utilities Commission to designate days for potential blackouts to each block. ???For example, a customer located in Block 3 of Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s service area could be told in advance that power will be turned off June 5 if blackouts are needed that day. ???\"Right now, every day is a potential blackout day,\" Briggs said. \"This way people would know when their potential days are.\" ??On alert ???-- When demand is high, the ISO will forecast peak demand, power supply and weather 24 hours in advance. ???-- A \"power watch\" will be issued when it is likely the grid will reach Stage 1 (system is within 7% of running out of power) or Stage 2 (system is within 5% of running out of power). ???-- A \"power warning\" will be issued when there is at least a 50% chance of a Stage 3 alert (demand is within 1.5% of supply). ???Who calls a blackout? ???Engineers in Folsom at the Independent System Operator keep watch on the state's power consumption. When they determine that energy reserves have dipped below 1.5 percent of available capacity, the ISO can order utilities to start cutting juice. Officials said this week they would give 30 minutes' notice before blackouts begin. The ISO tells the utilities exactly how much power to cut. ???Q: Who decides who gets blacked out and for how long? ???A: That's up to the utilities. PG&E has divided its 4.5 million customers into 14 blocks; each block is darkened for one to two hours at a time. The blocks are defined by PG&E's network of circuits rather than by geography. Thus, neighborhoods in San Francisco, Oakland and Pleasant Hill can be blacked out simultaneously. ???Q: How many users are blacked out at once? ???A: Each of PG&E's 14 ???blocks represents about 550 megawatts of electricity. (A megawatt is enough electricity to power 1,000 homes.) If PG&E is told to cut more than 550 megawatts, it can shut down two or more blocks at a time. PG&E also can black out smaller portions within each block if the ISO's requirements are for less than 550 megawatts. ???Q: How is power shut off? ???A: This is a straightforward matter of shutting off circuits in a power substation by computer or sending a crew to flip the switches by hand. ???Q: How many days of blackouts have we had this year and how many customers have been affected? ???A: A total of 3,035,000 customers have been blacked out in the six days of rolling blackouts since Jan. 1, 2001. ???Q: Which block of customers will be blacked out next? ???A: Some or all customers in Block 1. ???Q: How do I know what block I'm in? ???A: Look for the words \"Rotating Outage Block\" followed by a number on your bill. If it says Block 50, you share an electrical circuit with a hospital, police station or other \"essential service\" that is normally exempt from service cuts. ???Q: What should I do when the lights go out? ???A: Power experts advise: ???-- Turn off all lights and appliances to prevent damage-causing power surges when service is restored. Leave one light on to indicate when the electricity is back. ???-- Use caution when driving because traffic signals may be out. Treat all intersections as a four-way stop. ???-- To protect food, open refrigerator and freezer doors only when absolutely necessary. ???-- Keep a flashlight and radio with fresh batteries available. If you light candles, observe the usual safety precautions. ???-- If the lights go out, check with neighbors to determine if only your home is affected. It may be a downed power line or some other problem, in which case you should alert PG&E or your city electrical bureau. ???-- When the power returns, turn on one appliance at a time to prevent power surges. ???-- Don't plug a generator into the wall; when the lights return, it can send a high-voltage current through the system that can electrocute power workers. ???-- Tell children who are home alone to remain calm, to turn off the TV and computers, and not to use candles. ???Sources: PG&E, Chronicle staff ???Chronicle Graphic ??E-mail Lynda Gledhill at lgledhill@sfchronicle.com.

It received mixed reviews from an anxious public that appears to want quick relief but sees the plan only helping after several years. ??Although Bush says his program will allow Americans to retain the lifestyle they are accustomed to, only 30% of those surveyed said they believe it. Two of three said major lifestyle changes will be necessary to solve the nation's energy woes. ??Nearly half said the Bush plan would not do enough to conserve energy, and 43% said the plan would do too little to increase production. ??Americans also were split over the Bush proposal to increase the number of nuclear power plants to generate electricity: 49% for and 46% against. ??The tepid response to the Bush energy plan might have been a factor in raising his job-disapproval rating from 31% a week ago to 36% now, the highest of his presidency. His 56% job-approval rating did not change from a week ago. ??Bush's strongest disapproval came from Democrats, low-income earners, women under 50 and residents of California, a state wrestling with electricity shortages. ??California Democratic Gov. Gray Davis was highly critical of the Bush plan. He said it \"does nothing to address the astronomical run-up in the prices of electricity, natural gas and gasoline (and) favors more energy production at the expense of everything else.\" ??White House spokesman Claire Buchan said the president will continue to press his plan, regardless of the polls: \"The president does not govern by polls. This is a serious issue that has been neglected for years, and he has begun a serious dialogue with the American people. It will continue.\" ??Most poll respondents said they see threats of electricity shortages and the rising price of gasoline and heating fuels as serious problems, although only 12% said they see a \"state of crisis.\" And most of those polled said Bush is not doing enough to address those problems. ??At the same time, most said energy companies have too much influence over the administration's energy polices, an argument Democrats raise. ??One in five said the Bush administration deserves a great deal of blame for the energy problems; 28% put a great deal of that blame on the Clinton administration.

Maybe that is the reason for his optimism: the north and the south, Alaska to Patagonia, extend farther, suggest a future wider, than the American future bounded by coastlines. ??\"Along with his far northern ambition for the Alaskan wilderness, Mr. Bush has broached with the Mexican president, Vicente Fox, the possibility of building power plants in Mexico for American consumers north of the border. Such schemes reveal him to be perhaps a visionary, as much as he seems a man oblivious of the lessons John Muir discovered in California. ??\"Which is only to say, there is a wisdom in the way the Texan sees our American future. ?There is also a wisdom to the way Californians understand that future.\" ??FRANK LEADS CHARGE ??A group of 22 House Democrats yesterday sent a letter to all U.S. senators urging them to delay the confirmation of solicitor general candidate Theodore Olson \"until he gives a full and honest accounting of his role\" in a magazine's investigations of former President Bill Clinton. ??\"As members of various House committees with jurisdiction over the investigations that resulted from accusations of wrongdoing against President Clinton, we became very familiar with the quality of these accusations,\" they wrote. ?\"To our disappointment, we found that there was a consistent pattern . . . of ideological opponents of the president making irresponsible, unfounded, and often scurrilous charges.\" ??Led by Rep. ?Barney Frank, Massachusetts Democrat, the group is asking senators to defeat Mr. ?Olson's nomination \"if it turns out that he was deeply involved in this disinformation campaign.\" ??Mr. ?Olson has told the Senate Judiciary Committee that, as a member of the American Spectator's board of directors, he learned of the magazine's so-called \"Arkansas Project\" in mid-1997. He has said he did not take an active role in the investigative project. ??The panel voted 9-9 on party lines last week on Mr. ?Olson's nomination, and Senate Democrats are demanding more documents and information about his involvement with the magazine before a floor vote on the nomination. ??BUSH COURTS RIORDAN ??Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, a Republican serving his final days in that office, may run for governor against incumbent Democrat Gray Davis in 2002, National Journal reports. ??\"You can say I'm giving it serious thought,\" Mr. ?Riordan said in an interview with the magazine. ??Previously, the 71-year-old Mr. ?Riordan had expressed support for Los Angeles investment banker William E. ?Simon Jr., who has been readying his candidacy for the Republican nomination. ?But that was before a May 1 phone call from President Bush in which the president wished the mayor a happy birthday - and urged him to think about the governorship. ??\"I think he sees this as a chance to revive the party, and the president was extremely encouraging and very persuasive,\" Mr. ?Riordan said. ?\"As you know, the Republican Party in California has been an endangered species now for several years.\" ??BUSH BETTERS DAVIS ??California Gov. ?Gray Davis blames President Bush for his state's electricity woes, but a new survey finds that Californians have a higher opinion of the president than of their governor. ??Only 46 percent of 2,001 respondents in a poll conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California gave Mr. ?Davis a positive job-approval rating, down from 63 percent in January. ?And only 29 percent of those polled approved of the way the Democrat is handling the electricity crisis.

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Californians will soon be waking up to the weather, the traffic and a blackout forecast. ??The operator of the state's electricity grid said Monday that it will start issuing forecasts 24 hours ahead of expected rolling blackouts. ??The agency also promised to give 30 minutes' warning before it orders utilities to pull the plug on homes and businesses, a move that could prevent traffic accidents, stuck elevators and costly shutdowns at factories. ??Up to now, the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning, saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. The utilities have also resisted giving warnings, saying they did not want to tip off criminals. ??\"People are asking for additional notice, so we're doing our best to make that a reality,\" said Lorie O'Donley, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator. ??Californians have been warned that rolling blackouts could be a regular feature this summer. The state's power system, crippled by a botched effort at deregulation, has been unable to produce or buy enough electricity to power air conditioners on hot days. ??The rolling blackouts move from neighborhood to neighborhood in a sequence that is determined by the utilities and is difficult or impossible for the public to predict. The outages last 60 to 90 minutes and then skip to another neighborhood. ??Because of the lack of notice, the six days of rolling blackouts to hit the state so far this year have led to pileups at intersections suddenly left without stoplights, people trapped in elevators and losses caused by stopped production lines. People with home medical equipment like oxygen fret they that they will be cut off without warning. ??The new plan by the ISO borrows from the language of weather forecasters: Beginning May 30, it will issue a \"power watch\" or \"power warning\" that will give notice the grid could be headed toward blackouts. ??The ISO will issue 30-minute warnings to the media and others before any blackouts begin. However, the ISO will not say what neighborhoods will be hit. ??\"Any time is better than none,\" said Bill Dombrowski, president of the California Retailers Association. \"Obviously, we'd like more, but we're realistic about what they can do.\" ??The plan falls far short of what some consumer groups and legislators are demanding. ??State Sen. Debra Bowen has said she envisions giving consumers three to five days' notice that their power will be cut during a particular period, so businesses could shut down or shift their operations to non-peak hours such as nights and weekends.

The plant, owned by local power wholesaler Pinnacle West Energy, will produce enough electricity to serve about 120,000 homes, though much of it may be sold elsewhere. ??On Monday, PG&E National Energy Group, a sister of California's financially squeezed PG&E Gas and Electric, broke ground for its planned $500 million generating plant west of Phoenix that will use natural gas. ??It's one of up to 11 plants planned for Arizona by out-of-state interests. Three such plants are expected to begin production this summer, though much of their power also may be sold to other states. ??That's true of the PG&E National plant, too, but those who live in the vicinity don't care. ??\"We have nothing out here now,\" said Elisa Bigbey of Harquahala Valley. \"We want to get something going.\" ??The plant will increase the assessed valuation of the area by 17 times and will generate $10.7 million in new property taxes. PG&E already has given the local school district a portable shed in which to store records because the district's only school was damaged by a November fire. ??PG&E also is making a no-strings outright gift to the community of $550,000 in 11 annual cash installments. A committee of local residents will decide how to spend the windfall. ??Meanwhile, Panda Energy of Dallas and Teco Power Services of Tampa, Fla., recently broke ground for a plant south of the PG&E site, and Duke Energy North America of Charlotte, N.C., and Sempra Energy of San Diego each have started plants in the Arlington Valley. ??Pinnacle West Generating has a plant under construction near the Palo Verde nuclear plant in this same general area. ??Additionally, the Desert Basin Plant in Casa Grande is owned by Reliant Energy of Houston. The Griffith Energy Plant near Kingman is owned by Duke Energy and P&L Global. The Southpoint plant, set to begin production next month near Bullhead City, is owned by Calpine Corp. of San Jose. ??Such plants have come to Arizona because there's lot of space in Arizona, water is relatively inexpensive, there's access to natural gas, regulators are friendly and the plants can be situated at a distance from urban air pollution controls. ??The PG&E plant will produce nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxides that can lead to formation of ozone, an air pollution problem against Phoenix has been fighting for years. ??Additionally, the plant will use 6,500 acre feet of water a year, enough to meet the needs of a town of about 30,000. PG&E expects to use surplus Central Arizona Project water from the distant Colorado River - but the Harquahala Valley has a good supply of underground water PG&E can tap if the CAP surplus disappears.

The Independent System Operator will also be issuing a daily energy forecast with projected supply and demand, and the likelihood of blackouts. Several lawmakers say they'll introduce plans that would give Californians even more notice of blackouts - from one day to one month. ??- The state auditor releases a report on the state's energy crisis, saying previous estimates that the state could avoid blackouts this summer are overly optimistic. The Bureau of State Audits also criticized the California Public Utilities Commission, saying the commission hasn't responded to the crisis by expediting transmission line project. ??- Gov. Gray Davis is in Chicago, speaking with city officials there about blackout procedures. ??- Davis' energy advisers say that the state is meeting its energy goals, despite doubts raised by Controller Kathleen Connell and other critics. Connell questioned whether the state can buy enough electricity cheap enough to avoid borrowing more than the $13.4 billion approved by state lawmakers. But Davis adviser Joe Fichera says the state has signed more long-term power contracts that will help keep prices low. ??- Davis' office announces that an eighth \"peaker\" power plant has been licensed. The 135-megawatt plant in Gilroy is expected to be online by the end of September. The California Energy Commission says that more than 10,000 megawatts of new electricity since April 1999. ??- The California Energy Commission also announces increased rebates for renewable energy systems - such as solar panels, fuel cells or small wind generation. Rebates of up to 50 percent on the system are available for residential, commercial, industrial or agricultural users. ??- Republican legislative leaders criticize Davis for spending tax money on a political communications firm that previously advised Vice President Al Gore. Davis is hiring Gore's former press secretary and deputy campaign manager for six months at $30,000 a month to coordinate the governor's communications on energy issues. Senate GOP Leader Jim Brulte and Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox say Davis should pay them with campaign funds, not taxpayers' money. ??- Shares of Edison International closed at $11.23, down 51 cents. PG&E Corp. dropped 48 cents to close at $11.16. ??WHAT'S NEXT: ??- Davis' representatives continue negotiating with Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas and Electric Co., to buy the utility's transmission lines. ??- Davis is scheduled to sign a bill Tuesday that would expedite power plant siting. ??- Republican Assemblyman Mike Briggs plans to introduce a bill that would allow people to know a month ahead if they will be affected by rolling blackouts. ??THE PROBLEM: ??High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's electricity crisis. ??Edison and PG&E say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June to high wholesale prices the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. ??Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power costs. ??The Public Utilities Commission has approved average rate increases of 36 percent for residential customers and 38 percent for commercial customers, and hikes of up to 49 percent for industrial customers and 15 or 20 percent for agricultural customers to help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power buys.

It also banned cab drivers from talking on cellphones while driving, or as city officials put it, ''No Yakking While Hacking!'' concludes the study from the agency's compliance programs branch. ??___ ??Energy Group: Ontario Consumers Must Be Wary on Electricity Rebate ??TORONTO (AP) ??Ontario consumers may be unwittingly signing away a valuable rebate on their electricity prices to private utility companies, says the head of an energy watchdog group. ??The Market Power Mitigation rebate was created in 1999 to offset a potential rise in power prices once Ontario's electricity market is opened to competition, sometime next spring. ??Sales representatives from private electricity marketing companies have been knocking on Ontario doors for months, asking homeowners to sign on for a fixed electricity rate when the market opens. ??Tom Adams, director of Energy Probe, says consumers may not notice a fine-print clause which, in many of the agreements, hands the potential rebate over to the electricity firm. ??While there may be nothing wrong with such a clause, consumers by and large don't even know it or the rebate exists, Adams says. ??''If the price is right, it's a balanced transaction, but the problem is nobody has any information, and the public agencies aren't doing their job of explaining it to us.'' ??The rebate is supposed to kick in for consumers when the yearly average cost of electricity for a household rises above a benchmark price of 3.8 cents per kilowatt hour. ??The rebate is designed to shield consumers from massive price spikes such as those seen in Alberta and California, where deregulated markets have recently seen a tripling of prices and rolling blackouts. ??___ ??Man Accused of Killing Alberta Girl Is Due in Court ??LETHBRIDGE, Alberta (AP) ??Sylvia Koopmans was bracing Monday for the moment when she would face the family friend charged with the murder of her youngest daughter. ??Koopmans said she planned to attend Tuesday's first court appearance of Harold Anthony Gallup, 31, who is charged with the kidnapping and first-degree murder of five-year-old Jessica. ??''I need to be there,'' said Koopmans, who planned to watch the provincial court proceeding supported by her boyfriend and her father. ??''I need him to see me ... I want him to see my face.'' ??Gallup, whose girlfriend Roseanna Soenens was Koopmans' best friend, was charged Saturday by Lethbridge police. He had been in custody since May 12, when he was charged with a car break-in at nearby High River. ??Koopmans said Gallup was a regular visitor to her home and had been playing there with Jessica, her sister and two other kids the day the little girl disappeared. ??Jessica vanished May 4 after she went to play at a friend's house. ??Her tiny body, naked and bruised, was found a week after she disappeared. A couple walking a dog made the grisly discovery in a farmer's field near Fort Macleod, Alberta, about 50 kilometres from her home. ??Police have not said if she was sexually assaulted.

It is at once a triumph of technology and Western gumption, and a reminder of how tenuous it all is. ??The great growth in the West followed a simple recipe: Water plus power equals population. There was always a feeling that the land was so big you couldn't use it up, not the resources, not the space. ??Today there are signs that's no longer true. In California, blackouts. In Oregon and Washington, drought. In Arizona, arsons to stop construction. And in every rearview mirror, more traffic all the time. ??The allure of vast prairies, open skies and endless opportunity is what first drew people out West. But as deserts disappear under development, possibilities become problems. ??Now, with its infrastructure strained by growth, the West faces difficult choices: Energy or environment? Freeways or orchards? Water for people or fish? ??\"We're losing what we've come for, this ideal,\" says James Corless, California director of the Surface Transportation Policy Project, which aims to diversify transportation systems to reduce traffic and pollution caused by growth. \"And we are loath to change.\" ??--- ??When the streets went dark in California, a light bulb came on across the West. ??The region saw its vulnerability. For one very important resource, demand had won out over supply. What about all the others? ??\"We've got an infrastructure that can't really carry much additional power. We're starting to see the same situation with water,\" says John Maddox, president of the Denver-based Center for the New West. ??And people keep coming. ??The West added more than 10 million people in the 1990s, making it the fastest-growing region in the United States. In the next decade, another 10 million are expected. ??\"What does that mean?\" Maddox says. \"How many new roads, new water infrastructure and treatment facilities, how many new runways and airports?\" ??Perhaps more than clogged freeways and periodic droughts, the power crisis has brought home the reality that there are limits to growth. ??In California, electricity consumption rose 24 percent in the past five years as the economy grew by 29 percent. However, no major new plants were built in the state in the past 10 years, according to Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ??Several projects to generate new power were shelved in the 1990s, because of regulatory red-tape, environmental protests, economics and wariness over the state's deregulation plan. ??As a result, the power ran low and California was forced to go to the open market in search of electricity, sending power rates soaring and shutting out the lights in rolling blackouts. ??California officials now predict it will take two to three years before energy production catches up with demand. ??Meanwhile, the crisis has crossed state lines. In the Northwest, generating capacity grew 4 percent in the 1990s, while demand grew 24 percent. That wasn't a problem when abundant rain and snow produced above-average hydropower generation between 1995 and 2000. ??Then drought hit, and generation dropped. Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana are about 3,000 megawatts short of the electricity they need. ??Now everyone's playing catch-up. California is on a plant-building spree, while other states are pushing conservation and looking for alternative fuel sources. ??Even in power-hungry Las Vegas, the mega-resorts are cutting back. The MGM Grand refitted its 5,000 guest rooms with low-watt fluorescent bulbs and changed its casino-floor lighting. Treasure Island's parking garage is switching to sodium bulbs that use 30 percent less energy. ??But a feeling of dread is gripping some Westerners. If the lights can go out, what's next? Dry faucets? ??\"The thing I worry about is water,\" says Carol Ann Heggie-Hall, a retired science teacher who moved from Queens, N.Y., to Henderson, Nev., in 1999. \"Is there enough water for everyone and their plants?\" ??Much of the West is facing the worst drought in a quarter-century, prompting warnings of environmental degradation, forest fires and agricultural decline. Nevertheless, experts say the West isn't in danger of running out of water. The challenge is determining who gets how much. ??\"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that if the faucets ran dry in Scottsdale, there are places to go to get water,\" says Joe Hunter, a power and water specialist at the Center for the New West. \"But it means shifting it from one use to another.\" ??About 80 percent of water in most Western states is used to irrigate crops, a percentage that could drop if residential supplies were strained, Hunter says. ??Western states and cities must also do more to share water. ??California has long used more than its allocation from the Colorado River, which supplies drinking water to seven Western states. An agreement allows California to receive surplus water if it implements conservation measures that will reduce its reliance on the river in the future. ??In the meantime, Western cities are looking elsewhere to sustain the supply. The Las Vegas Valley predicts it will reach its annual Colorado River allocation by 2007, so its regional water authority is negotiating to store 1.2 million acre feet of water in Arizona for the next 15 years. ??Beyond power and water, other infrastructure problems persist. In the Vegas area, which added 700,000 people in the '90s, road closures due to highway expansions are a daily occurrence. ??\"There are few roads you can drive on that aren't under construction,\" admits Jim Gibson, mayor of Henderson, a city south of Vegas that is among the country's most rapidly growing communities. ??Without the new roads, Vegas transportation officials estimate there would be 2,289 miles of congestion by the year 2025, compared with 341 miles last year. ??Highways alleviate congestion, but also drive more growth. ??Interstate 5, the north-south freeway through Washington and Oregon, became a growth magnet. In Colorado, Interstate 70 has opened the mountains to staggering growth west of Denver. ??-- ??In the fastest-growing metro area in the fastest-growing state in the fastest-growing region of the country, Greg Cox and Dale Stark are unloading dirt on a Las Vegas street crammed with construction workers. ??The landscapers are a rare breed in a town teeming with newcomers: Cox has lived here all his life; Stark moved from Southern California in 1979. ??Both grumble about the changes they've seen, and both vow to leave. ??\"I moved here when this town was nice,\" Stark says. \"Now you can't drive down the road without getting cut off and flipped off.\" ??Cox complains he can barely get around at all. A drive across town used to take 20 minutes. Now, he grunts, \"You've got to pack a lunch.\" ??Both agree: Even Las Vegas, the city built on the very idea of unlimited resources and space, is reaching its limits. ??The sentiment is spreading across the West: Unbridled growth must stop. ??Planning experts insist cities must reinvest in old neighborhoods rather than build new ones, and provide incentive to plan for growth in a way that incorporates existing infrastructure. ??Portland, Ore., has been a national leader with its urban growth boundary. In San Francisco, a program provides federal money to developers who build homes near transit stops. ??Still, when initiatives to rein in growth were placed on the ballot in several Western states last November, most of the big measures failed - including one in Arizona to force developers to pay for new infrastructure. Opponents warned that growth controls would be bad for business. ??In Las Vegas, despite infrastructure challenges, the official line remains that growth is good. ??\"As long as you can take care of the social problems and quality of life problems, there's never such a thing as too much growth,\" declares Mayor Oscar Goodman. \"Once you stop growing, you stagnate.\" ??And so for now, the fountains flow, the marquees shine. ??And the people keep coming. ??On the Net: ??Center for the New West: www.newwest.org/ ??Sierra Club sprawl campaign: ??Census stats: ??Las Vegas growth topics website: ??Surface Transportation Policy Project: http://www.transact.org/ ??Brookings Institution's Center on Urban and Metropolitan Policy: ??EDITOR'S NOTE - Pauline Arrillaga is the AP's Southwest regional writer, based in Phoenix. ??End ADV for May 26-27 GRAPHIC: AP Photos NY372-375 of May 21, AP Graphic WESTERN GROWTH, AP LOAD-DATE: May 22, 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS Associated Press The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ????????????????????????May 21, 2001, Monday, BC cycle SECTION: Domestic News; Business News LENGTH: 648 words HEADLINE: California will forecast blackouts and warn the public BYLINE: By JENNIFER COLEMAN, Associated Press Writer DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif. BODY: ??Californians will soon be waking up to the weather, the traffic - and a blackout forecast. ??The operator of the state's electricity grid said Monday it will start issuing forecasts 24 hours ahead of expected rolling blackouts. ??The agency also promised to give 30 minutes' warning before it orders utilities to pull the plug on homes and businesses, a move that could prevent traffic accidents, stuck elevators and costly shutdowns at factories. ??Up to now, the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning, saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. The utilities have also resisted giving warnings, saying they did not want to tip off burglars and other criminals. ??\"People are asking for additional notice, so we're doing our best to make that a reality,\" said Lorie O'Donley, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator. ??Californians have been warned that rolling blackouts could be a regular feature this summer. The state's power system, crippled by a botched effort at deregulation, has been unable to produce or buy enough electricity to power air conditioners on hot days. ??The rolling blackouts move from neighborhood to neighborhood in a sequence that is determined by the utilities and is difficult or impossible for the public to predict. The outages last 60 to 90 minutes and then skip to another neighborhood. ??Because of the lack of notice, the six days of rolling blackouts to hit the state so far this year have led to pileups at intersections suddenly left without stoplights, people trapped in elevators, and losses caused by stopped production lines. People with home medical equipment like oxygen fret they that they will be cut off without warning. ??The new plan by the ISO borrows from the language of weather forecasters: Beginning May 30, it will issue a \"power watch\" or \"power warning\" that will give notice the grid could be headed toward blackouts. ??The ISO will issue 30-minute warning to the media and others before any blackouts actually begin. However, the ISO will not say what neighborhoods will be hit. ??\"Any time is better than none,\" said Bill Dombrowski, president of the California Retailers Association. \"Obviously, we'd like more, but we're realistic about what they can do.\" ??Assemblyman Fred Keeley, the Legislature's point man on energy, acknowledged that scheduling blackouts could attract criminals and open the state to legal liability for accidents at blacked-out intersections. ??\"That is a genuine problem and genuine concern,\" Keeley said earlier. \"I think we would have to work with local governments so they could have a sufficient advance notice to be able to foresee that and try to deploy their resources appropriately.\" ??The ISO said it also is looking into high-tech ways it can get word of an impending blackout quickly to homeowners and businesses through mass e-mails, faxes, automated phone calls and pager messages. ??The plan falls far short of what some consumer groups and legislators are demanding. ??State Sen. Debra Bowen has said she envisions giving consumers three to five days' notice that their power will be cut during a particular period, so businesses could shut down or shift their operations to non-peak hours such as nights and weekends. ??State Assemblyman Mike Briggs said he plans to introduce a bill that would have the Public Utilities Commission notify businesses and homeowners as much as one month ahead of time when they would have their power cut. ??\"We owe the people of this state some kind of schedule,\" Briggs said. \"If businesses and individuals knew what days their power could potentially be shut off or blacked out, they could plan for that blackout accordingly.\" ??On the Net: ??California Independent System Operator: http://www.caiso.com LOAD-DATE: May 22, 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS Associated Press The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ????????????????????????May 21, 2001, Monday, BC cycle SECTION: Domestic News LENGTH: 229 words HEADLINE: Survey: Gov.

Forty-four percent believe it is on the right track. ??The poll also found that Californians blame the electric utility companies more than anyone else for the energy crunch.

And if generators don't lower the price, the state should schedule blackouts to cut consumption, he said. ??The report by Navarro and the Utility Consumers' Action Network says the state's current method of \"highly disruptive random rolling blackouts\" needs to be revamped. ??UCAN suggests that the state be divided into blackout zones that utilities could notify ahead of time that power would be cut at a specific time and for a certain duration. ??Scheduling blackouts could attract criminals to outage areas, Keeley acknowledged, and possibly could subject the state to legal liability for traffic accidents or other incidents if power is deliberately shut off. ??\"That is a genuine problem and genuine concern,\" Keeley said. \"I think we would have to work with local governments so they could have a sufficient advance notice to be able to foresee that and try to deploy their resources appropriately.\" ??Critics of the planned blackouts said power producers simply could sell their unused electricity to other states, or trim back production to keep supplies short. ??Assemblyman Mike Briggs, R-Fresno, plans to introduce a bill this week that would have the Public Utilities Commission notify businesses and homeowners as much as one month ahead of time when they would have their power cut. ??\"We owe the people of this state some kind of schedule,\" Briggs said. \"If businesses and individuals knew what days their power could potentially be shut off or blacked out, they could plan for that blackout accordingly.\" ??The Central Valley Republican said the ability to plan for outages would be especially benefit farmers, who need power to irrigate their crops. ??Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, who convened a special subcommittee on blackouts, has also suggested the state should consider scheduling daily blackouts to cut the state's power use and drive down prices. Democratic Assembly members plan to introduce their own version of a blackout plan. ??Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, has said she envisions giving consumers three to five days notice that their power will be cut during a particular period, so businesses could opt to shut down or shift their operations to nonpeak hours such as nights and weekends. ??And by treating blackouts as a first option rather than a last resort, the state could cut its peak power needs and drive down prices, Bowen said. California power consumers would in essence form \"a reverse cartel to stop the market manipulation and the price gouging,\" she said. ??The planned blackout suggestions come as state officials grow increasingly concerned that power prices will keep rising this summer, even beyond the extraordinary levels the state already has been paying on behalf of three cash-strapped privately owned utilities. ??Gov. Gray Davis said the state paid $1,900 per megawatt hour at one point last week. ??The state has dedicated $6.7 billion since mid-January to purchase power for Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric. ??Those expenditures will be repaid this summer when the state issues $13.4 billion in revenue bonds. The bonds will be repaid by ratepayers over 15 years. ??--- ??On the Net: ??California Independent System Operator: http://www.caiso.com/ LOAD-DATE: May 22, 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS ???????????????????The Associated Press State & Local Wire The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ????????????????????????May 21, 2001, Monday, BC cycle SECTION: State and Regional LENGTH: 901 words HEADLINE: 'Baseline' becoming key word for electric customers BYLINE: By KAREN GAUDETTE, Associated Press Writer DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO BODY: ??A little calculation on electric bills is fast becoming a big concern for millions of residential customers of California's two largest utilities. ??Sitting near the top of Southern California Edison electric bills, and near the bottom of the last page of Pacific Gas and Electric bills, is a number called baseline, which guarantees a certain amount of electricity at the lowest price utilities charge. ??This number, which differs from customer to customer based on a host of factors, is the benchmark for determining how much more residents will pay for electricity come June - when the largest rate hikes in California history start showing up on bills. ??\"Now with deregulation and prices being so much higher, it's going to require that people educate themselves about their bills the same way they had to do when long distance telephone service was deregulated,\" said Commissioner Carl Wood of the Public Utilities Commission. ??Under a rate-hike allocation plan approved Tuesday by the PUC, everyone who exceeds baseline by more than 30 percent will pay progressively more for that additional electricity - with the heaviest residential users facing a 37 percent average hike on their overall bill, translating to an increase of roughly $85 a month. ??State law ensures that residential customers who don't use more than 30 percent above baseline will not face the rate hikes. The PUC figures around half of PG&E and Edison customers now fall into that category. ??But consumer rights groups, and even the utilities, think the PUC is underestimating residential electric use, given the recent proliferation of home computers, cell phone chargers and the like. ??They think baseline is set too low for many customers, and say families and people who work at home will pay more than their fair share of the rate hikes. ??\"It's an anti-family action. People with kids have a hard time staying within baseline,\" said Mike Florio, senior attorney with The Utility Reform Network. \"A rate hike of 30 to 40 percent could be 100 percent for people with large households.\" ??Since 1982, when lawmakers created baseline - given in cents per kilowatt hour per month - to ensure a minimum amount of affordable power and encourage conservation, the PUC has determined baseline by dividing the state into climatic and geographic regions. ??PG&E has 10 such regions within its service territory in northern and central California; Edison has six in central and southern California. ??The PUC then finds the average amount of electricity use for customers within each region. The baseline quantity is 50 percent to 60 percent of that amount, and up to 70 percent of that amount during the winter months if a customer uses only one type of energy (electricity or natural gas). ??Customers who depend on electronic medical equipment such as suction, breathing and dialysis machines, can apply for a slightly higher baseline. ??A family living in the scorching hot Coachella Valley would have a larger allotment of lower-priced electricity than a family living in breezy Monterey, given that air conditioning for the former is necessary to survival. ??Since baseline is based on averages, a single apartment dweller and a family of four who live in the same region could have the same baseline. That makes it more likely for the family to get hit with rate hikes and less likely, economists fear, that the apartment dweller has a financial incentive to conserve. ??\"Where it is imperfect is that it has no ability to make any adjustments for the size of the family,\" said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman. ??Focusing baseline on household size gets complicated, Florio said. \"Does PG&E come by and do bed checks?\" ??Along with raising $5.7 billion to replenish the state's general fund for power buys since January, the rate hikes approved March 27 by the PUC and allocated on Tuesday were also meant to trigger conservation that could help avoid rolling blackouts this summer. ??Baseline has not been reassessed since the early 1990s. PUC president Loretta Lynch and fellow commissioner Wood say they may hold hearings as early as this coming week on possible inequities and ways to update the system. ??\"There was plenty of testimony at public hearings that people suspect that baselines are not appropriate or are not calculated right,\" Wood said. ??Wood said when baseline first was created nearly 20 years ago, houses were smaller and many lacked central air conditioning. ??Though the PUC has updated baseline amounts through the years, \"living standards have changed, housing standards have changed and it may be that average usage is different from what it was,\" Wood said. ??Florio said giving baselines a second look could go either way for consumers. There are typically more electronic gadgets in homes these days, but many of those gadgets and appliances are more energy efficient than their ancestors. ??Add that to increased conservation statewide, Florio said, and there's a slim chance baselines could actually go down and expose more customers to rate hikes. ??\"It's a percentage of average use historically, and people have used energy more efficiently,\" through the years, Florio said. ??--- ??On the Net: ??California Public Utilities Commission: http://www.cpuc.ca.gov ??Pacific Gas and Electric Co.: http://www.pge.com ??Southern California Edison Co.: http://www.sce.com LOAD-DATE: May 22, 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS ???????????????????The Associated Press State & Local Wire The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ????????????????????????May 21, 2001, Monday, BC cycle SECTION: State and Regional LENGTH: 273 words HEADLINE: New poll suggests Californians haven't been this gloomy for years DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO BODY: ??Not since the mid-'90s have more Californians believed the state is headed in the wrong direction. ??And it may get worse. ?Nearly 60 percent of state residents expect the economy to worsen in the next year, while about 40 percent see a brighter horizon, according to a new poll. ??The telephone survey of 2,001 adult Californians was done over eight days in early May by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California.

Headlines proclaimed a \"crisis,\" and legislative leaders shifted into an \"I told you so\" mode. ??Hold the phone. ??This is not California. There is no crisis. Customers with interruptible service contracts have always been subject to cutoffs in times of peak consumption or when generators are down. ??It may not be fair to suggest that Alliant Energy chose to idle three of its biggest generators to make the case for changing the law, but the timing is nonetheless convenient. The Legislature is set to convene a special session in a few weeks, and among the business left over from the regular session could be a bill to make it easier for power companies to build electric generating plants. ??While crisis is not imminent, Iowa does face the prospect of consuming more electricity than the state's utilities are able to generate themselves. ... ??While Iowa's law may need some \"streamlining,\" which could be dealt with in a special session, that should not be the end of the matter. Ultimately, the Legislature must fashion a long-range energy policy for this state that takes a regional view of energy, that reflects new market and regulation realities, and that seizes the potential for conservation and renewable alternatives to fossil fuels. ??Legislative session: ??TELEGRAPH HERALD ??Even after a marathon legislative session - this one lasted 121 days - why does it always seem the big-ticket items are pushed through in the final days? ??This year's session started out strong, passing a bill to save taxpayers money by eliminating the sales tax on residential utility bills. It finished up by coming through with $40 million for teachers' pay. ??But just what happened in those middle 100 or so days is a little murky. There was plenty of hand-wringing about the budget shortfall, the usual banter about dove hunting and a fair amount of partisan bickering. ... ??-Legislators didn't get around to a ... bill to close a loophole in Iowa's Open Records law. The way it stands now, a governmental body can use a private contractor to investigate problems within the department and keep that contractor's report confidential under the law's whistle-blower provision. ... ??-The Legislature didn't want to get into a full-blown gambling debate, so it didn't address a tax freeze at racetracks. ... The issue of fairness needs to be addressed. ??Floating casinos pay a 20 percent tax, while racetracks pay a gradually increasing tax that now stands at 30 percent. Under the law enacted in 1997, that tax will grow to 36 percent by 2004. ??-Other things that legislators talked about but didn't get around to include: cutting state income tax on Social Security income and a pair of bills addressing the state's bottle-deposit law. ??So the 2002 Legislature will have its work cut out for it. Here are some jobs for next year's to-do list: ??-Amend the Open Records Law. Allowing agencies to keep information about government activities secret simply because it is in the possession of an outside contractor is a hole in the law that needs to be fixed. ??-Carry the ball on increasing teachers' pay. The $40 million shot in the arm will have been a waste if the program is left hanging unfunded. ??-Freeze the amount of tax racetracks pay where it stands and stop the hemorrhaging of dollars into state coffers. The disparity between racetracks and riverboat casinos needs to be righted. ??And if they're worried that the discussion will draw an all-out gambling debate, lawmakers might want to bring it to the table before May. ??IOWA CITY PRESS-CITIZEN: ??We agree with Gov. Tom Vilsack that the new state budget approved by legislators \"will cause hardship for people and families across our state.\" ??That's what happens when you face a $300 million revenue shortfall, and you don't have as much money as you wanted. ??But we disagree that \"for 3 1/2 months, they did very little.\" ??On the contrary, Vilsack got what he said all along would be the high mark of this session - $40 million for teacher pay raises and a new system for teacher pay. ??And the Republican-led Legislature also agreed to phase out the sales tax on utilities, long a goal of Vilsack's Democratic Party. ??Are we happy with the budget? No. ??Is it the best we likely can do under the circumstances? Yes. ??Vilsack should sign budget legislation, rather than vetoing it and calling a special session of the Legislature this summer. ... ??Plant Sciences Institute: ??DES MOINES REGISTER: ??Iowa needs more people, especially young people. Iowa needs more jobs that pay well - the kinds of jobs that cause other businesses, small and large, to spring up here. So why did Iowa lawmakers blow the single best opportunity for both? ??They blame it on a tight budget. Blame them for failing to grasp the big picture. The fledgling Plant Sciences Institute at Iowa State University could become a major force in the fast-growing field of biotechnology related to agriculture - yet the 2001 Legislature provided no new money. ??It did continue the $4.67 million approved in 2000. It did not add $3 million, a meager increase proposed by the governor. It allowed ISU to keep money from the sale of land, with proceeds to be used for the institute's Roy J. Carver Co-Laboratory, to be completed by 2002. It should have added at least $10 million in cash. ... ??Because of legislative inaction, promising initiatives must slow down, or may never take place. ... ??The institute had hoped to hire another top researcher in the field of corn genomics ... ??Ag-biotech companies have been appealing to the state for help putting together a protein-extraction facility ... Such a facility might extract protein from conventional or genetically modified plants for such uses as pharmaceuticals, food additives or chemical enzymes for industrial processes. The Plant Sciences Institute has a small, pilot protein-extraction facility. New money from the Legislature would have allowed it to assist businesses in establishing a commercial facility. But now? \"The people interested in this will probably go elsewhere,\" said Director Stephen Howell. ??Why wouldn't they? Plenty of other states are serious about fostering biotech industries. The Iowa commitment is hardly encouraging. ... ??Iowa has a budget crunch because its economy and population are not growing fast enough. Investing in biotechnology - the technology that is expected to drive the next great wave of economic growth - is the most promising way to make Iowa's economy and population grow. Stinting on that investment is stunningly shortsighted. ??Ten million dollars next session should not be out of the question. The question should be what sort of future will Iowa have if it does not make the most of the potential the Plant Sciences Institute holds. ??Hunting requirements: ??AMES TRIBUNE: ??In April, the Iowa House and Senate rejected a measure that would have required wild turkey hunters to report their harvest to the Department of Natural Resources, saying it was \"just another hassle,\" for hunters. ??Then, the House hiked the fees for hunting licenses, in some cases up to 218 percent. A non-resident who wants to hunt deer in Iowa under this plan will have to shell out $308, including a hunting license and habitat fee. The current total is $156. ??Hassle? You got it. We might as well hang a sign on Iowa borders that says we don't much care about managing our wildlife and we don't want you here, either. Add to the mix a federal whammy in the Freedom to Farm Act, which has all but eliminated any fence rows, and hunting as a potential tourism draw to Iowa blows away in the wind. ... ??Instead of having accurate information on how much hunting is affecting turkey populations, Department of Natural Resources wildlife managers are now left to guess. ... ??Surrounding states which capitalize on their resources require even more harvest registration, and it hasn't slowed interest. ... ??The DNR asked for the fee increases for good reasons - license fees have not increased for a decade while the costs of salaries, travel and equipment have begun to eat into funds available for facilities and land acquisition. And we're in favor of using fees to support wildlife management. ??We also would allow that some of the increases do not seem to us to be egregious. A $3 fish habitat fee for instance, isn't a great deal to pay. Nor is a $30 tab for a non-resident 7-day fishing license out of line. ??But some fee hikes were too much. ??In particular, the non-resident fees for deer hunting are high especially in comparison to surrounding states, and are more than most ordinary people are likely to pay. Wisconsin charges non-residents $135 to hunt deer. Missouri charges $125. License fees in Iowa are likely to result in less money coming in, not more. What out-of-state hunter will be drawn to Iowa when surrounding states are managing their herds better and charging less to visit? ??Iowa worries that the farm economy is in the tank. We wring our hands as our young people rush to other parts of the country. We say that our natural resources here can be an attraction that will draw people back. Yet these votes run counter to sound wildlife management and increased tourism. ??Public official recruits: ??QUAD-CITY TIMES: ??More Iowa school districts and local governments are using professional companies to help find high-level administrators such as superintendents, but that recruiting tool is making the process less accountable to the public. ??In effect, it allows private firms to dictate public policy, and that's troubling. ??One example of this trend is the Camanche School District, where six finalists for the superintendents job were in town for interviews recently. They met with school board members, district staff and some residents, yet the board does not intend to reveal the names of the candidates. The Cedar Rapids headhunter firm that has contracted with the district advised the school board not to announce the names. ??Headhunters also are advising candidates to request their names be kept confidential. Under Iowa law, a public entity such as a school board must honor such a request. ??Some public officials justify this secrecy by arguing that finalists don't want the public to know if they didn't get the job offer or worry that identification may jeopardize their current position. ... ??Those arguments aren't justified, for reasons including: ??-There is nothing dishonorable in not being chosen for a top-level post. Indeed, being considered a finalist for such a job may serve only to enhance a candidates attractiveness for another position ... ??-Identifying the finalists for the public also allows citizens to ask questions and provide other information, critical or supportive, that could be useful in helping officials make a final choice. ??-And being upfront with the public lends credibility to the entire process ... ??We prefer a process similar to one used by the City of Clinton during its recent search for a city administrator. The five finalists were not only identified, they took part in an open house to meet the public. A headhunter firm was used, but City Attorney Bruce Johansen, himself a candidate who did not get the job, said he made it clear to the agency that the finalists names should be made public. ??We applaud that effort ... ??Meanwhile, the Iowa Legislature this spring modified a state law that has been the basis of confidentiality claims for candidates seeking public positions. The change would require that official communication between private contractors and the public entities they serve be open to public inspection. Whether that law will be interpreted to include headhunter firms remains to be seen. ... ??We encourage school boards and local governments to resist confidentiality and test the new law when it takes effect July 1. ??Train service: ??CEDAR RAPIDS GAZETTE: ??Who'd have thought that the selection of the secretary of the federal Department of Human Services last winter might affect whether Davenport, Iowa City and Des Moines get rail service. ??But consider that HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson, who resigned recently from the Amtrak board, had been a strong advocate of expanded rail service here in the Midwest while he was governor of Wisconsin. Thompson had hoped to remain chairman of the Amtrak board after he went to Washington. But the Associated Press reports that a 1997 law that restructured the Amtrak board says only one of the seven seats can be held by a member of the Cabinet - and the Bush administration wants Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta on the governing board. ??Few people around are as passionate as Thompson about Amtrak, and Iowa could have benefited. It's hard to ride a national passenger train service that doesn't go where the majority of Iowans live. Maybe the service will be expanded here. But maybe, with the changes in the governing board, that train has already left the station. ??Smoker identification: ??LE MARS DAILY SENTINAL: ??Have you heard the news from Walgreen's? They're going to card everybody who wants to buy a package of cigarettes, a box of cigars, a can of chew. ??Everybody. Not under 18. Not 27 and under. Everybody. ... ??That can't have been an easy decision. Within a year, they're looking at software that will require clerk's to enter a customer's birth date into a computer before a tobacco sale can be completed. Until then, they're asking their clerks to card everybody. Good for them. ... ??Yes, it will take a little extra time ... Evidently, the owners/corporate bigwigs think the time is well spent if it eliminates the fines and bad publicity. ??A convenience store association spokesman told reporters that other stores are likely to duplicate Walgreen's efforts. Yes. We certainly hope so. ??We all have heard terrible numbers of deaths caused by tobacco, of underage users ... Many, if not most of us, know someone who hacks and coughs, who died from smoking, who cries because someone died from smoking. When you think of them, it doesn't seem so outrageous to card everyone. It seems downright brilliant. ... ??It won't stop it entirely. Young wanna-be-smokers will have somebody older do the buying, or swipe a carton. There will always be a way to get around it, there always is. ??Still, carding everyone says, \"This is important, we mean it and we're not going to make it easy for you.\" LOAD-DATE: May 22, 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS Content and programming copyright 2001 CNBC/Dow Jones Business Video, a division ??of CNBC/Dow Jones Desktop Video, LLC.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. MARK HAINES, CNBC ANCHOR, SQUAWK BOX: One company that is hurting a lot in all this is PG&E, the parent of Pacific Gas and Electric. They filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April. PG&E has about $9 billion in unrecovered power costs. A California bankruptcy judge says the company cannot raise retail rates to recoup those losses. The stock is on a steep decline this year, trading in the 52 week range of 6 to 32, last at about 11 1/2. Joining us to tell us where things are now and where they could be going, Robert Glynn, PG&E's Chairman and CEO. Mr. Glynn, good to see you again. ROBERT GLYNN, CHAIRMAN & CEO, PG&E: Good morning, Mark. HAINES: So where do we stand now? GLYNN: Well, we're working our way through the federal bankruptcy proceeding, where we affirmatively stepped in order to resolve issues between ourselves and our creditors. We have a plan of reorganization under development and we're getting close to the time when we can begin to share that plan with the creditors who, after all, need to get paid. HAINES: So let's first talk about time. How much time do you think this might take before PG&E emerges from bankruptcy? GLYNN: Well, it's very hard to tell for one reason. There have not been very many utility bankruptcies and I don't know of any that has had these complexities to it. The shortest possible time or shortest likely time that I've heard about has been six to eight months and that's probably shorter than it will take. The longest that I've heard about is about four years and that's an awful lot longer than I want it to take. HAINES: In the meantime you are selling electricity, transmitting and selling electricity on a retail level. Are you still losing money on your operating? GLYNN: Well, the potential area for continuing loss exposure is the issue of whether the California independent system operator is still buying on behalf of our company instead of buying directly on behalf of our customers. And that's an issue that's before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for decision making right now. HAINES: Well, I guess my question is who is paying the bills right now? GLYNN: Well, the electric rates in California have just been raised by the California Public Utilities Commission in order to have the state, the Department of Water Resources be able to recover all of its costs because that's what, of course, it wants to do. It doesn't want to go any deeper in debt than it has to. So this most recent large rate increase has applied, as best as we can tell, exclusively to cover the state's cost increases and not to cover some of the ones that we're responsible for. JOE BATTIPAGLIA: Mr. Glynn, the brownouts continue in California. What's the status of supply of electricity into the state, putting aside for a moment how you pay for it? GLYNN: Well, the California electricity crisis at its heart is a supply shortage and the outlook for this summer and next summer are pretty bleak. Every responsible entity that has reviewed the situation is forecasting that there will be a large number of rolling blackouts occurring over the summer of 2001 and probably 2002 as well, simply because there's not enough power to go around. BATTIPAGLIA: Does that spread from California to other states as the draw down becomes perilous? GLYNN: Well, the California electricity market and the Pacific Northwest markets have had a very nice symbiotic relationship over many, many years shipping power back and forth to one another. That has been interrupted because of the supply shortage in California, which means that California is trying to be a net importer all the time. And it seems like the Pacific Northwest won't have the kind of surplus energy to send south to California that it's had in the past. HAINES: Does this ultimately end with retail electricity distribution transmission and distribution being done by a state authority and no longer by privately held or publicly held companies? GLYNN: I don't think it ends there at all, Mark. And I certainly don't think that it's in the state's interest to try to get into businesses that can be done by private capital when the state has so many other important things to use its capital on, like education and infrastructure. And I do think that this supply shortage has got to be resolved. It's got to be resolved by building new supply. There's simply no alternative to that and that's going to take another couple of years before that new construction is fully completed. HAINES: All right, sir. Thank you very much for the update. We appreciate it. Robber Glynn, PG&E's Chairman and CEO.

BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Everything I know about the spoken word I learned right here at Yale. ??(LAUGHTER) ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??ANNOUNCER: Now Judy Woodruff takes you INSIDE POLITICS. ??JUDY WOODRUFF, CNN ANCHOR: Thank you for joining us. ?We begin with the Bush administration responding to pressure to get more involved in promoting Middle East peace. ??As an escalating cycle of violence between Israelis and Palestinians continued today, Secretary of State Colin Powell appointed a diplomat to help the two sides end the fighting and resume talks. ?And he urged the parties to use the report of a commission appointed by former President Clinton as a springboard to peace. ??Let's get more now from CNN national security correspondent David Ensor -- David. DAVID ENSOR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Judy, Ambassador William Burns, the U.S. ambassador to Jordan, who is Mr. Powell's pick to be the next assistant secretary for the Middle East, has been asked to work with other recommendations for Mr. Powell and for President Bush on how the U.S. can best proceed from here, trying to use the recommendations of the Mitchell committee report to try to get the violence to de- escalate, to try to get the two sides talking instead of shooting at each other. ??Here is how Mr. Powell put it today. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??POWELL: It is now up to the leaders in the region to show that they have heard this clarion call from this committee in a loud-and- clear way, and take actions that are available to them on both sides to let's have a cessation of hostilities, then we can begin the confidence-building measures and move toward negotiations. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??ENSOR: Now this report makes very specific recommendations and urges very specific actions by both sides: in both cases, quite difficult actions. ?First, it calls for the Palestinians and the Israelis to declare an immediate, unconditional cessation of violence. That's the first step, and that's the step that Secretary Powell repeatedly emphasized today must come first and must come right away or else nothing else will work. ??But the report goes on to make specific recommendations. ?For example, it urges that Israel put -- freeze all settlement development, all development of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories. ?It recommends that Israel resume paying the money that's collected in taxes back to the Palestinian Authority. ?It recommends a whole range of action, many of them to be taken by Israel, which the reports says would help bring the tone back to where it needs to be, would help bring the two sides back to where they could once again be negotiating instead of shooting at each other and letting off bombs. ??The -- the secretary, Secretary Powell, said that this is not the time, however, for him to get involved in shuttle diplomacy. ?He wants first to have Ambassador Burns and the others come up with recommendations over the next week, two weeks or three, and then he and the president will try to figure out where the U.S. can go from here. ??But clearly, this is -- clearly, this is a first step by an administration that until now has tried to keep its -- keep its powder a bit dry in the Middle East. ?They are now engaging somewhat, because they're so concerned about the situation out there, Judy. ??WOODRUFF: David, the report, the Mitchell report, suggesting that the Israelis more responsible here, or at least that they have more to do in order to get things back on the peace track than the Palestinians? ENSOR: The report is very even-handed. ?It doesn't blame either side for the situation. ?It, for example, does not blame Ariel Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount for the following Intifada, Intifada II it's been called. ?But it says that there needs to be a series of actions by both sides to bring down the tensions, and if you look at the list of what it's asking for, there are more steps that the Israelis would have to take than the Palestinians. ??WOODRUFF: And David, why is it that the administration is saying at this point that it is not prepared to get back in -- in a -- in a day-to-day way, in an energetically involved way the way the Clinton administration was? ??ENSOR: Well, I think the administration, this administration, feels that the Clinton people got -- got to the point where they were micromanaging the thing a little bit. ?It was too much presidential involvement and it was too much of a day-to-day hand-holding operation. ?They feel they need to hold back a little bit and try to get the parties to talk to each other. ??However, the situation is deteriorating pretty rapidly, and so now they realize they have to have some greater involvement. ?And that's why Ambassador Burns has been asked to prepare these recommendation, Judy. ??WOODRUFF: All right. ?David Ensor reporting for us from the State Department. ??For more on the Middle East conflict, stay with us for a special half-hour report. ?That's beginning at 6:00 p.m. Eastern. ??Now, we turn to questions about the Bush administration's political fund-raising tactics. ?Tonight, Vice President Dick Cheney is scheduled to host some 400 big GOP donors at his official residence in Washington. ?A spokeswoman for the Democrats says that that event smacks of, in her words, hypocrisy. ??The Democrats say the reception at the vice president's home is comparable to Clinton-era events, such as White House coffees and Lincoln Bedroom sleepovers for big donors, which drew heavy criticism from Republicans. ?Among them: presidential candidate George W. Bush. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??BUSH: I believe they've moved that sign, \"The buck stops here,\" from the Oval Office desk to the buck stops here on the Lincoln Bedroom. ?And that's not good for the country, it's not right. ?We need to have a new look about how we conduct ourselves in office. There's a huge trust. ?I see it all the time when people come up to me and say, \"I don't want you to let me down again.\" ??And we can do better than the past administration has done. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: Despite that sort of criticism then, the Republicans are defending their fund-raising tactics now. ?Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott had this to say about the reception for big donors at Vice President Cheney's home tonight. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??SEN. TRENT LOTT (R-MS), MAJORITY LEADER: I'm sure it's being done in an inappropriate way, or Dick Cheney wouldn't -- wouldn't be doing it. ?So if there's any question, I'd suggest you address it to them. ?Unfortunately, I think that most of us will not be able to be there. ?We're going to be here voting, giving tax relief. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: Virtually all of those GOP contributors, who will mingle with Vice President Cheney at his home tonight, have given at least $100,000 to the Republican National Committee. ?They will also attend a major RNC fund-raiser tomorrow night that features President Bush as the main speaker and is expected to net some $15 million in soft money. ??Now let's bring in our White House correspondent, Major Garrett. ??Major, tell us about what this event is about tomorrow night. ??MAJOR GARRETT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's the first official Republican National Committee event to honor the president and the first lady, as you said. The targeted haul is $15 million. Republican National Committee officials tell CNN that it's about 70 percent of that 15 million will be soft money. ?About 30 percent will be hard dollars -- that is dollars that are regulated under the existing campaign finance scheme -- and that it is a big event, one that the Republican Party has held for years and years in Washington. ??As for what's happening in the vice president's residence tonight, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer told me this is a way of saying \"Thank you,\" in his words, \"to those Republicans who,\" as Ari Fleischer said, \"did so much to help win the selection.\" ??And he draws a distinction with the Clinton-era coffees and sleepovers, describing them as, quote, \"organized schemes to bring people through the gates of the White House to get money or to persuade others to do so.\" ??Mark Minor, who is the communications director for the Republican National Committee, also said that no one paid to go to the vice president's residence. No checks will pass between hands there. There is no quid pro quo, and that some people who will be at the vice president's residence tonight are not in fact RNC donors -- Judy. ??WOODRUFF: So, Major, again, clarify the distinction between money events that are given as a thank you and events that are given as an encouragement to give more money. ??GARRETT: Well, it's a distinction this White House wants to draw as clearly as it possibly can. ?In the words of Ari Fleischer, thanking someone, whether it's on government property or not on government property, is a completely legitimate activity for the president or the vice president to engage in. ?The distinction he is drawing is that during the Clinton era people were brought to the White House, to these coffees, and as was disclosed in the Thompson report that was conducted by the Senate investigating that, there was some evidence of actually targeted lists: that people who were brought in, money was described to bringing in for a coffee. ?A certain dollar amount was attached to donations to the Democratic National Committee, a larger amount if they, in fact, slept here at the White House in the Lincoln Bedroom. ?That is the key distinction, the Republicans say: that there is no targeting necessarily of these people to come to the vice president's residence. ??They also point out that the original letters inviting these big donors to Washington did not in any way suggest there would be a reception at the vice president's residence: the point there being these people donated without any expectation of having dinner or reception with Lynne Cheney and Dick Cheney in the vice president's home. ??WOODRUFF: And Major, just to clarify, the 400 people invited tonight to the vice president's, how many are they saying did not give money? ??GARRETT: They're not disclosing any numbers. ?They're only saying that some have given. ?They clearly and readily acknowledge that. ?Some are lobbyists. Some represent large corporations. ?But others, they say, are just Republican National Committee officials. And others of an undisclosed nature -- not fund-raisers, not Republican Party officials -- who will be there tonight. Don't have any numbers for you on that, though. ??WOODRUFF: All right, Major Garrett reporting at the White House. Thank you very much. ??Vice President Cheney maybe taking some heat for fund-raising tactics, not to mention his role in creating the Bush energy plan. Look that this: ??Our new poll shows Cheney's job approval rating is 4 points higher than the presidents. ?While Mr. Bush's approval rating has held pretty steady in the past couple of weeks, he has lost ground since late April. ?Cheney's approval rating has dipped as well. ??For more on Mr. Bush's ratings and how they relate to his policies, we are joined now by our senior political analyst Bill Schneider. ??Tell us, Bill, which of Mr. Bush's policies is the most popular? ??WILLIAM SCHNEIDER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, you might guess energy, given the high ratings for Dick Cheney that you just reported -- but you would be wrong. ??Because, what Americans like best is the tax cut. ?Two thirds of the public now favors a substantial tax cut. ?That's up from 60 percent earlier this month. Well, why not? ?What's wrong with getting some money back from the government? ??Actually, most people do not think the tax cut could benefit them much financially. ?They like it because they believe it will help the economy. ?And that is why so many Democrats find it very difficult to oppose. ??WOODRUFF: What about the energy plan? ??SCHNEIDER: Not such a success. ?Not like the tax cut. ?Americans are actually divided over the president's energy plan. ?Why? ?It's not because the public blames the Bush administration for the nation's energy problems. ?Most people blame the oil companies. ??In fact, more people blame Congress and the Clinton administration and environmental laws and American consumers than blame the Bush administration. But most Americans still give President Bush low marks on energy. ?The core criticism of his energy plan is: it doesn't do enough. ?55 percent of Americans say President Bush is not doing enough to solve the country's energy problems. ??What doesn't the plan do? ?It doesn't do much right now. ?Only 8 percent of Americans believe the plan will help the nation's energy problem immediately. Most people think oh, it will help, but only after several years. ?It's a long-run solution. ?Americans want help now. ?Right now. ?With electricity in California. ?And with gas prices all over the country. ?Long-term solutions are important, but politics is a short-term business. ?If the problem is now, people want results now. ??And they don't see what the Bush energy plan is going to do about $2-a-gallon gasoline now. ??WOODRUFF: Why do people think the energy plan fails to do that? ??SCHNEIDER: Because they think this administration is run by oilmen. ?Oilmen like $2-a-gallon gasoline. ?Maybe even 3. ??By nearly two to one, the public believes energy companies have too much influence over the Bush administration's policies. ?In fact, Americans are split when you ask them whether the Bush energy plan is designed to further the country's interests or the energy companies' interests. ?That sounds like breathtaking cynicism. ?But any administration that's run by Texas oilmen is automatically suspect. ??WOODRUFF: All right, Bill Schneider, thank you very much. You're not suspect. ??SCHNEIDER: I am certainly not. ??WOODRUFF: At least as far as we know. ??Do Californians blame President Bush for their energy crisis? We've heard a little bit from Bill on that. ?That answer and more on the issue later this hour. ?Plus: ??Just what kind of tax cut is the Senate considering? ?Jonathan Karl crunches the numbers. ?Also: ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have no ability to bring up the amendments. ?You don't set the agenda every day, and that is real power in the House. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: The trials and tribulations of the minority leader, as he considers the present and the future. ?And later: ??Rewarding a president's most controversial decision. ?A political \"Profile In Courage.\" All ahead on INSIDE POLITICS. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ??WOODRUFF: President Bush today donned the traditional commencement robes, and gave the graduating class at Yale University a few bits of advice. ?The president also included a glimpse at his less-than-perfect college years. ?As CNN's Kelly Wallace reports, today's speech was a departure from how the President's dealt with his alma mater in the past. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??KELLY WALLACE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A homecoming of sorts, George W. Bush who has only been back to his alma mater once since graduating in 1968, returns to address those at the top and the bottom of Yale's graduating class. ??BUSH: And to the C students... ??(LAUGHTER) ??I say, you too, can be president of the United States. ??(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) ??WALLACE: The president offering a self-deprecating account of his days as the undergraduate, when, as a history major, he earned modest grades and was known more as a fraternity boy prankster than a rising political star. ??The visit was not without controversy, with some students protesting and some professors boycotting, charging that Mr. Bush was not yet deserving of an honorary degree. ??PETER BROOKS, YALE UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR: It doesn't seem at present to represent the intellectual ideals and the service to humanity in which we think that Yale stands for. ??WALLACE: The president has kept his distance from this Ivy League institution for most of his political life, painting it as a symbol of elitism, even during his days at Yale. TERRY JOHNSON, BUSH'S YALE ROOMMATE: What George -- does not respond well to are people who are snobs, whether you are a social snob or an intellectual snob or any other kind of snob. ??WALLACE: Mr. Bush rarely mentions what he did on this day, that he was born in New Haven when his dad, the former president, was an undergraduate at Yale. ??BUSH: My life began just a few blocks from here, but I was raised in West Texas. ?From there, Yale always seemed a world away. ??WALLACE: The president, for years, had been miffed with Yale for not awarding an honorary degree to his dad until 1991, the third year of his presidency. ?But it appears now, all is forgiven. ??BUSH: In my time they spoke of the Yale man, I was really never sure of what that was. ?But I do think that I am a better man because of Yale. ??WALLACE: Mr. Bush, the son and grandson of Yalies and now father of a current student, seems very proud that Yale is a part of his past. ??Kelly Wallace, CNN, New Haven, Connecticut. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??WOODRUFF: And looking now ahead to 2004: the Reverend Al Sharpton says that he will explore seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. ?The civil rights activist said yesterday that the party did not protect the rights of disenfranchised voters in Florida in the last presidential race. ??If he runs, Sharpton said that he would promote issues that concern blacks and progressives, and his effort would not be just symbolic. ?Sharpton ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in New York in 1994 and for mayor of New York City in 1997. ??Reverend Sharpton and former Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer will discuss President Bush's faith-based plan to help the poor tonight on \"CROSSFIRE.\" That's at 7:30 p.m. Eastern. ??Another note from New York: a state supreme court justice today barred Rudy Giuliani's girlfriend from the mayor's official residence, Gracie Mansion. ?The judge ruled in favor of Giuliani's estranged wife, Donna Hanover, who had requested a restraining order barring Judith Nathan from the residence. ?The ruling says that Nathan may not enter the residence as long as the Giuliani children continue to live there. ?The judge also denied Giuliani's second attempt for a gag order in the couple's divorce proceedings. ??And we'll have the latest on President Bush's tax cut when we come back. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) WOODRUFF: This evening, the Senate is expected to vote on the latest version of the now $1.35 trillion tax cut plan. ?Republican leaders hope to give President Bush the tax cut for approval before Memorial Day. ?But as Jonathan Karl reports, taxpayers will have a longer wait before reaping any of the measure's benefits. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??JONATHAN KARL, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Senate's $1.35 trillion tax cut would be the biggest in a generation, but don't spend your tax windfall yet. ?Most of the cuts will not take effect for several years to come. ??Relief from the so-called major penalty will not start until the year 2005. The estate tax won't be repealed until 2011. ?That means even if President Bush is re-elected, it wouldn't take effect until two years after he completed his second term. ?The IRA contribution limit would be raised from $2,000 to $5,000, but that also wouldn't happen until the year 2011. ??The tax cut calls for doubling of the child tax credit, but that takes 10 years too. ?The credit would rise from $500 to $600 this year, slowly increasing in $100 increments over the next 10 years until it finally reaches $1,000 in the year 2011. ?The cuts in income tax rates would be phased in even more slowly. ??SEN. CHARLES GRASSLEY (R-IA), FINANCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: You are right, some of them do not -- are phased in over a period of time. But there is real relief in this tax bill for every taxpayer starting January 1, 2001. ?They don't have to wait until next year. ??KARL: That immediate tax relief amounts to $300 for individuals and $600 for couples filing jointly, but just how that money gets back to taxpayers is still to be worked out. ?The option favored by the president is a simple rebate check sent directly to taxpayers, an idea opposed by many Senate Republicans who call it impractical. ??But the rebate would represent a fraction of the overall tax cut, which Democratic opponents say will explode in cost after it's fully phased in two years from now. ??SEN. KENT CONRAD (D), NORTH DAKOTA: This plan is fully back- loaded. ?That means simply that it is disguised in terms of its full cost. ?This decade it cost $1.35 trillion. ?In the next decade, it will cost from 3.5 to $4 trillion. ??KARL: But there's a little noticed provision of this tax cut that may make that point moot. ?The tax cut includes a sunset provision, that means all the tax cuts in the bill would expire in the year 2012. ?For the tax cuts to remain in place, Congress would have to pass them again. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??KARL: Now, the Senate is expected to vote on a series of amendments to the tax cut later on today, paving the way for a final vote on the tax cut here in the Senate tonight. ?But it will not end there. ?This still needs to be reconciled with the tax cut that was passed in House, the House passing almost exactly the president's tax cut, including much deeper cuts in income tax rates preferred by Republicans. ??The Senate and the House will have to work out their differences. They're expected to do so this week, setting the stage to send this final tax cut down Pennsylvania Avenue and onto the president's desk by Memorial Day -- Judy. ??WOODRUFF: Jon, when you talk about the plan providing 300 or $300 a year per individual, divided by 12, that's $20-some a month. Is this the kind of money the president was talking about when he said the tax cut would help people with higher gasoline prices? ??KARL: This was exactly what he had it mind. ?This was exactly what he was talking about, directing the money right into the hands of taxpayers, directly into the hands of those people paying higher gasoline prices at the pumps. ??This is an idea that his Treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill, strongly favors, the idea of direct cash payments or check payments to taxpayers. ?But one big problem with this, Judy, is that taxpayers over the course of time move, they change addresses, some of them die. The question is, how do you make sure you get all the right checks to those people at current addresses? ?It's not an easy proposition. ??WOODRUFF: And Jon, one other subject, we know the president's nominee to be solicitor general of the United States has run into a real problem in the Senate committee. ?Where does that stand right now? ?The last we heard, the Senate Judiciary had split 9-9 on the nomination of Ted Olson. ??KARL: Well, the Senate leaders, Trent Lott and Tom Daschle, are now actively involved in this, trying to come to some kind of an agreement, an agreement that will allow the Democrats to get access to some information they want about Olson, especially information that was compiled by independent council Robert Ray, looking to just what Olson's involvement was in that Arkansas Project by the \"American Spectator\" magazine, the investigation into Bill Clinton's personal life. ??They want information from the independent council to look at just how involved Olson was in that project, to see whether or not he was truthful in his testimony when he said he was not very involved at all. ?There's some movement to try to get the Democrats on the committee more of the information, also maybe to release more of it to the public. ??If that's all done, it would set the stage for a vote on the Olson nomination before the full Senate, but probably not until after Memorial Day. ?The Senate goes on recess at the end of the week, they will be off all of next week, you probably won't see a vote on the Olson nomination until after they return. ??WOODRUFF: All right, Jon Karl at the Capitol, thanks. In the House of Representatives, Democrats are finding themselves drowned out by the Republican majority. ?Add to that, critics who say the party is lacking leadership and strategy. ?And life in the House minority begins to look bleak. ?Our Kate Snow caught up with the House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt to talk about the balance of power and his political future. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??REP. DICK GEPHARDT (D-MO), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: We need to say what are we for, and that's what... ??KATE SNOW, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Dick Gephardt will tell you it's frustrating being a Democrat these days, stuck in the minority without the backing of the White House. ??GEPHARDT: Well, you take what you -- what you are given. ?I mean, the people run this country. ?We don't. ?And so, you fight for what you believe in as hard as you can, and if you really believe in it, then you're frustrated if you're not able to those policies through. ??SNOW: Gephardt says the Democrats are forced to play defense, responding to Republicans. ??GEPHARDT: I think we slowed down a little bit the amount of the tax bill -- not enough, in my view -- but we lowered it some so that the potential deficits out there in the future won't be so large. ?I think we cooperated with the president on the educational bill, at least the substance of it, but we still haven't been able to convince him or the Republicans to put enough money into education to really make the program happen. ??On energy, I think that we've got a very, very positive alternative that I hope people will listen to. ?People in California and Oregon and Washington need help now. ??SNOW: That was last week's theme. ?First at a gas station, the lawn of the Capitol the next day, and then in a underground war room. ??Gephardt is a master at staying on message, often spending hours talking to the press, his strategy: agree with Republicans when he thinks they're right and hammer at home when he disagrees. ??GEPHARDT: If we do not learn from history, we are forced to repeat it. ?This is a mistake that we will pay for for years to come. ??I try not to yell. ?I try to get ideas across as good a way as I can. ?But there are times when you need to show your emotion. ?You need to let people know that you really care about this. ?And you really want the country to go in a different direction. ?And I think you can't appear too tentative or too laid back or too uninterested. ??SNOW: But is the strategy working? ??I have talked to some Democrats who say that they are truly unhappy. Some of whom say that they are unhappy with your leadership. ?They don't feel that you're doing an effective job. ?Do you feel that there is trouble within the ranks? ??GEPHARDT: I don't. ?I think that -- I think the ranks and the Democratic Party are largely unified. ?They are marching together and working together in ways that I've never seen them before. ?I always tell them that it's me and we. And we have to be a team. ??I would never tell you that anybody is ever going to be pleased every day with everything that happens, but largely, I think that we've achieved real unity and real effectiveness in being the loyal opposition here in Washington. ??SNOW: How much of your days are spent thinking about 2002 in the next election? ??GEPHARDT: Well, I want to win the majority back. ?I think it's really important, not for the party and not for me, but for the country. ??SNOW: Is it more important to win back the majority than it is to win legislatively for the next couple of years? ??GEPHARDT: I think it is in the House for sure, because the minority is really out of power totally in the House. ?You have no ability to bring up amendments, you don't set the agenda every day. And that is real power in the House. ??SNOW: There is a lot of focus on 2004, a lot of talk about your ambitions, do you have plans to run for president? ??GEPHARDT: I really think that if you don't stay totally focused on the goal that is ahead of you, then you lessen your chances of reaching that goal. ?And my goal is to win back the majority in the Congress in 2002. ?I think, as usual in our system, we all want to look ahead and start calling the next race after that for president, but that is not what I'm doing and not what I should be doing. ??SNOW (voice-over): Gephardt insists he's not planning ahead, though he's scheduled to attend four events in New Hampshire in two weeks. ??GEPHARDT: The future will take of itself. ?I have no idea what will happen, and I'm not worried about it, and I don't spend time worrying about it. Because, again, I've got to do this in 2002. ?This is what we're trying to do. ??SNOW: So, are you committed to staying minority leader through 2002? ??GEPHARDT: Absolutely. ?I'm totally committed to winning this House back, and I think we are going to do it. ??SNOW: Speaker of the House, you said to me last fall that that had a nice ring to it? GEPHARDT: It works for me. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??WOODRUFF: Kate Snow talking with House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. ?They talked today. ?And later this week, Kate will sit down with House Speaker Dennis Hastert. ?You can look for that report on Friday. ??On another term for the another high-profile Republican and two nationally known Democrats with apparent home state ambitions. ??INSIDE POLITICS will be right back. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ??To no one's surprise, Charlton Heston was reelected today to an unprecedented fourth term as president of the National Rifle Association. ?The 77-year-old actor was chosen at the NRA's annual convention in Kansas City. ?The group changed its rules last year to allow Heston a third term, and a spokesman said there really wasn't much discussion by the board before deciding to elect him, once again. ??Former Attorney General Janet Reno may be looking for a new line of work. Now back in her native Florida, Reno says she finds the idea of running for governor appealing. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??JANET RENO, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL: I love Florida very much. I was born and raised there. ?I have lived there most of my life. ?And I want to make sure that I do everything I can, either as governor or otherwise, to serve the interest of the people of Florida. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: Reno says she does not believe that her Parkinson's Disease would keep her from running, and she expects to make a decision before the end of the year. ??Governor Jeb Bush says possible opponents do not factor into his decision on whether to run for reelection. ??House Minority Whip David Bonior may trade in his Congressional seat for a run at the governor's mansion. ?The 13-term Congressman from Michigan filed his paperwork today to become a candidate in Michigan's 2002 governor's race. ?His aides say that a formal announcement will come later. ?With Michigan slated to lose one House district, Bonior's seat may be vulnerable to the state's Republican controlled redistricting efforts. ?Republican Governor John Engler cannot seek reelection because of term limits. ??Californians and the energy crunch: are they pointing fingers at the president? ?We'll check new poll numbers from the Golden State, and discuss power politics in the state when we return. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ??WOODRUFF: At ground zero on the energy crunch: more than half of Californians say they disapprove of the way President Bush is handling that state's power woes, according to a new poll. ?But the survey shows more Californians are placing blame for the problem on utility companies, former Governor Pete Wilson and current Governor Gray Davis than on President Bush and the federal government. ?The Democrats are trying hard to convince Californians that Republicans should be held accountable for the power problem. ?Here is a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ad that begins airing in Los Angeles today. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??NARRATOR: California's energy crisis is deepening, with summer blackouts predicted and rate hikes of up to 80 percent. Yet President Bush has offered no relief to hard-pressed rate payers. ?His spokesman saying, \"The president continues to believe that the issue is mostly a California matter\" and our representative, Stephen Horn, has joined with Bush in opposing a temporary cap on electricity prices. ?Call Congressman Horn and tell him we need action now. ??That is if you can find the phone. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: The Democratic committee said that it has bought significant air time for that spot, part of a month-long radio and TV ad campaign targeting Republicans on energy. ?Let's talk more now about energy politics with the director of that Public Policy Institute of California poll we just told you about, Mark Baldassare joins us now from San Francisco. ??Mark, first of all, this poll finds Californians pessimistic in general, did that surprise you? ??MARK BALDASSARE, CALIFORNIA POLLSTER: It did. ?For the past three years, we've been in an incredible time of optimism in California. ?Two-thirds of Californians have said that the state is going in the right direction. ?Most Californians felt that economic times would continue to be good, and most Californians also were highly approving of the governor and the legislature. For the first time, we've seen a dramatic drop in optimism about the state, about the economy and ratings of the governor. ??WOODRUFF: And why do you think that is? ??BALDASSARE: Well, eight in ten Californians say they have been closely following the electricity situation in the state and most Californians are telling us in our survey that they consider it the top issue and 80 percent of Californians say it's a big problem and moreover, a problem that is going to effect the economy. ?So there's been a great deal of uncertainty that's been created by the electricity situation and because of that uncertainty, people are beginning to feel very nervous about our state. ??WOODRUFF: So you're saying because of the electricity crisis, if you want to call it that in California, it's now driving people's views of everything: population, the economy, across-the-board. ??BALDASSARE: We -- for the past few years people have been focused on improving the schools, for instance. ?Now only 6 percent in our most recent survey said that's the issue that concerns them most in the state. ?And we see that there is growing pessimism at the same time that there is growing concern that this electricity situation is not under control and could affect the state's economy. ??WOODRUFF: Explain for us, Mark, who people are blaming. ?We were -- Bill Schneider reported earlier on the program that Americans, overall, are having mixed views about to what extent President Bush is responsible. ?Here we're learning in California, they hold President Bush far less responsible than they do local leaders. ??BALDASSARE: Yeah, well, we are at time right now in California where people haven't experienced the rate hikes yet. ?They've certainly heard about them. They haven't experienced, for the most part, frequent rolling blackouts, but they hear that they're coming. And so when we talk about blame, people are focused on what happened five years ago to put us into this situation. ?And for that, of course, they don't blame either the current governor or the current president. ?Now, as we go forward over the next few months, people are going to be re-assigning blame as well as re-evaluating the solutions that are in place, and that's why I think both the Democrats and Republicans are very urgently trying to get their message out right now about who they think is to blame and who they think has the best solutions. ??WOODRUFF: Well, Mark, what is your reading on this? ?Are ads, like the ones we just saw the Democrats running out there, are those likely to have an effect on people's views? ??BALDASSARE: I don't think so. ?I think that what is will most going to have a effect on people's views over these next few months is how the crisis is actually resolved. ?And if people feel that these electricity hikes have really, you know, altered their lifestyle or they're going to impact the economy, if they feel blackouts are really going to, you know, put them in an uncomfortable situation going through the summer, then my guess is they are going to give blame both to Bush and to Davis. ??WOODRUFF: All right, Mark Baldassare of the California Public Policy Institute. ?Thanks very much, good to see you again. ??BALDASSARE: Thank you. ?Same here. ??WOODRUFF: As California tries to ease its energy problems, there are concerns about the cost not only for consumers, but for the environment. ?CNN's Rusty Dornin takes a closer look at the issues being raised by one California plant's effort to expand. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??RUSTY DORNIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): An aging giant known as the Mighty Moss. ?The 50-year-old Moss Landing Natural Gas plant along California's coast owned by Duke Energy. ?A face lift and an expansion will soon make this the largest power generator in the state, providing 2.3 million homes with light, heat and air conditioning. ?But all that power takes water to cool the turbines, water that's home to otters, fish, herons and other wildlife. ??CAROLYN NIELSEN, PLANT OPPONENT: Every day, Duke will use 333 football-size fields -- pools of water that are 10 feet deep. ?That is just incomprehensible. ??DORNIN: Water from the wetlands run through the plant, returning to the ocean 30 degrees warmer. ?Been that way for 50 years. ?Now environmentalists worry that increasing the intake will sterilize any creature sucked in. ??PATRICIA MATEJCEK, SIERRA CLUB: Everything that lives in that volume of water: eggs from fish from clams, diatoms, young fish, everything in it will be killed. ??DORNIN: Environmentalists say the Mighty Moss got a break on the approval process, as regulators here faced the state's energy crisis. It took 14 months. Permitting for smaller plants in the state is down to 21 days. ??KAITILIN GAFFNEY, CENTER FOR MARINE CONSERVATION: It's so fast that my concern is that we wouldn't even catch really obvious problems because we are just are not taking a hard look at these plants at all. ??DORNIN: But here's the twist as part of the permit process: local environmental groups signed off on the Mighty Moss renovation plan. ??GAFFNEY: So at the eleventh hour, we were able to work out this deal with Duke to at least ensure that the scientific monitoring will go on. ??DORNIN (on camera): Duke Energy will spend more than $8 million expanding the wetlands and in donations to local environmental groups. There will also be an independent monitor who will assess any damage to the environment. ??TOM WILLIAMS, DUKE ENERGY: This will more than compensate any potential effects that the new power plant will have on the habitat. This state is in an energy crisis. ?The new plant we're bringing on is cleaner, more efficient than virtually any plant in the country today. ??DORNIN: Environmentalists made a deal here, but many fear, in a power-hungry state, taking what they can get may be their only option. ??Rusty Dornin, CNN, Moss Landing, California. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??WOODRUFF: A very different kind of power politics, circa the 1970s, is being seen in a whole new light in some circles. ?Former President Ford is honored for granting a famous -- some would say infamous -- at pardon. ??That's next on INSIDE POLITICS. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ??WOODRUFF: It is something that many Americans that lived through the Watergate era might never dream they would see. ?An award named for a Democratic icon presented to the man who angered many Democrats by pardoning Richard Nixon. ??CNN's Bruce Morton has an inside view of this twist on political history. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??CAROLINE KENNEDY SCHLOSSBERG, JOHN KENNEDY'S DAUGHTER: He placed his love of country ahead of his own political future. ?We are honored to present you, President Ford, with the John F. Kennedy Profile In Courage Award for 2001. ??(APPLAUSE) ??BRUCE MORTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Gerald Ford, now 87, got the award because, as a new unelected president, he pardoned his predecessor, Richard Nixon, who had resigned in disgrace to avoid impeachment over the Watergate scandal. ??RICHARD M. NIXON, 37TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow. ??MORTON: \"Our long national nightmare is over,\" the new man said of Watergate. But really, what would end it? ?Nixon could still face charges. ??GERALD FORD, 38TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My conscience tells me that only I, as president, have the constitutional power to firmly shut and seal this book. ??MORTON: And so he granted: ??FORD: A full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon. ??MORTON: Many Americans thought that was a mistake. ??SEN. TED KENNEDY (D), MASSACHUSETTS: I was one of those who spoke out against his actions then, but time has a way of clarifying past events. ?And now we see that President Ford was right. ??MORTON: Not everyone agrees. ?Ford's press secretary at the time, Gerald Ter Horst, resigned to protest the Nixon pardon and still thinks it was wrong. ??JERRY TER HORST, FORMER FORD PRESS SECRETARY: He was going to go off scot-free, whereas all of his minions -- the people who worked at the White House, from the chief of staff on down to Ehrlichman, Chuck Colson and others -- they were going to have to do prison time; they were not going to get pardons. MORTON: And it may have cost Ford the 1976 election. ?It was a close election. Many things could have swung it, but the pardon was surely one. ?Jimmy Carter, who beat Ford, thanked him Inauguration Day. ??JAMES EARL CARTER, 39TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: For myself and for our nation, I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land. ??MORTON: Accepting the award, Ford talked about the need for courage today in a politics dominated by \"partisan jockeying at the expense of public policy.\" ??FORD: I sense a longing for community, a desire on the part of Americans to be part of something bigger, finer than themselves. ??MORTON: Historians may still argue about the pardon. ?They agree he cared about his country and its politics, and did what he thought was right. ??Bruce Morton, CNN, Washington. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??WOODRUFF: Also cited for political courage today, Democratic Congressman John Lewis of Georgia who was beaten, as he and others challenged segregation during the freedom rides through the South in 1961. ??Lewis was given a special Profile of Courage Award for Lifetime Achievement. ??Former president Ford, Congressman Lewis and Caroline Kennedy will all be guests tonight on \"WOLF BLITZER REPORTS.\" That's at 8:00 p.m. Eastern. ??That's all for this edition of INSIDE POLITICS. ?But of course, you can go on-line all the time at CNN's allpolitics.com. ?AOL keyword: CNN. ??And our e-mail address is insidepolitics@cnn.com. ??This other programming note: Priscilla Sue Galey, the former stripper who claims that FBI spy Robert Hanssen showered her with gifts, will be the guest tonight on \"LARRY KING LIVE.\" That's at 9:00 p.m. Eastern. ??I'm Judy Woodruff. ?Stay tuned for a CNN special report: \"Conflict in the Middle East\" coming up. ??TO ORDER A VIDEO OF THIS TRANSCRIPT, PLEASE CALL 800-CNN-NEWS OR USE OUR SECURE ONLINE ORDER FORM LOCATED AT www.fdch.com LOAD-DATE: May 21, 2001", "flagged": 0}

The July contract traded in a $= 0.06 range, ending up $0.005 at $3.742 per MMBtu. August gained $0.008 to $= 3.802 per MMBtu. The market was expected to dip to the $3.670 mark, but cou= ld not slide past $3.720, leading to some short-covering. The market remain= s under pressure from mild weather and a series of larger-than-normal stora= ge injections that have filled storage to 49% of capacity. Texas should ret= urn to very warm conditions this week. In addition, the Northeast and Midwe= st are expected to see a rise in temperatures early this week that will cre= ate stronger demand. At test of support at the May 30th low of $3.67 is lik= ely this week. The next level of support after $3.670 is seen at $3.570 and= then $3.50. Resistance was pegged at $3.98 and then again at $4.14. Natura= l gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally mixed to= down $0.05 Friday, except out west where spot prices continued to tumble. = The Southern California delivery point of Topock fell about $2.50 per MMBtu= , while Kern River and Opal dipped well below $2.00 per MMBtu.

Allegations against Duke Energy, as the plant's operator, included thr= owing out spare parts to prolong the time a unit was out of service and ram= ping electricity output up and down to manipulate power prices. Duke denied= the latest allegations by former workers at its South Bay power plant, say= ing it finds the charges disturbing and incredible. Duke says the time has = come for it to take a stand against this daily barrage of misinformation. C= alifornia has for months been accusing the Duke and other generators who pu= rchased many of the state's power plants of taking advantage of a chronic s= hortage of electricity and price gouging. The governor is demanding $9 bill= ion in refunds, and numerous lawsuits have been filed. The rhetoric has esc= alated into branding the generators as pirates and even murderers and rapi= sts of the California economy, most of which is a smokescreen to hide their= true agenda, the forced donation of power to the state. When Duke took ov= er the Southern California plant they kept on all of its employees for 2 ye= ars under an operating agreement. Once that agreement expired, Duke hired a= bout 80% of the staff.

San Jose Mercury News April 19, 2001, Thursday KR-ACC-NO: SJ-POWER LENGTH: 593 words HEADLINE: Testimony Indicates California Electricity Market Was Troubled in 1998 BYLINE: By Brandon Bailey BODY: ??SACRAMENTO, Calif.--California's electricity market was showing signs of trouble as far back as 1998, the year that it was officially opened to competition, members of a special legislative investigating committee were told Wednesday. ??Abnormal price spikes -- far higher than what should have occurred in a competitive market -- were showing up in August 1998, the committee was told by Frank Wolak, a Stanford economist and top advisor to the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state's transmission grid. ??Appearing on the first day of hearings called by a state Senate select committee to investigate alleged wholesale energy price manipulation, Wolak testified that the ISO's economic advisors repeatedly found signs that power suppliers were able to influence prices over the last three years -- even before wholesale prices soared skyhigh last summer. ??By controlling even a relatively small portion of power supply, just enough to make a difference in whether the state could meet consumers' needs, Wolak said, generators have been able to charge prices far higher than their costs. ??All told, the ISO has estimated, power suppliers collected more than $ 6 billion in unjustified profits last year. ??In his opinion, Wolak added, that violates the terms by which federal regulators allowed the suppliers to enter the state's newly deregulated market when it opened in 1998. ??The ISO is now filing petitions with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, asking that agency to revoke the generators' right to charge unregulated prices. ??But Wolak repeatedly told the committee that he had no evidence that the suppliers acted in collusion or that they had violated any federal anti-trust laws. ??When state Senator Joe Dunn, D-Garden Grove, pressed him on the point, Wolak insisted, \"I can't say yes, I can't say no. There's a lot of things that certainly look puzzling. It's hard without further information and analysis to say definitively, but there's lots of things to seem to be worth looking into.\" ??Dunn, a former consumer attorney, is leading the Legislature's efforts to answer a question that a host of other state and federal officials have also posed: have California's electricity prices been the result of any illegal or unethical acts? ??Power suppliers and their representatives have repeatedly said the answer is no. They say their prices are the result of short supplies and natural market swings. ??\"Eleven investigations into California's electricity market have been conducted or are currently under way,\" said a statement issued Wednesday by Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association. \"Not one has found or proven any wrongdoing by generators.\" ??Dunn, however, said Wednesday's testimony was only the start of what he promised would be a vigorous investigation. He said the committee has already asked several power companies for records and other information and he hinted that subpoenas may be issued in the coming weeks. ??\"We will try to figure out how to stop these high prices if they are unjustified,\" Dunn said at the beginning of the hearing. ??\"We're not going to be looking for ways to finance these payments,\" he added. The state is now paying $ 70 million a day to buy power for California consumers, after major utilities wracked up billions in debts while buying power on the open market in recent months. ??----- ??To see more of the San Jose Mercury News, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.sjmercury.com JOURNAL-CODE: SJ LOAD-DATE: April 19, 2001 of 5 DOCUMENTS ???????????????????The Associated Press State & Local Wire The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ??????????????????????April 19, 2001, Thursday, BC cycle AM Eastern Time SECTION: State and Regional LENGTH: 930 words HEADLINE: Developments in California's energy crisis BYLINE: By The Associated Press BODY: ??Developments in California's energy crisis: ??THURSDAY: ??- The state remains free of power alerts as reserves stay above 7 percent. ??- Gov. Gray Davis meets with 25 members of the California congressional delegation at the Los Angeles International Airport to discuss the state's power crisis. ??- An Assembly committee continues hearings on the natural gas supply and possible price manipulation. ??-The Public Utilities Commission meets in San Francisco to decide whether to investigate if a key bloc of independent generators are purposely keeping their plants offline. ??WEDNESDAY: ??- Unchecked free-market forces drove up the price of natural gas to Southern California Edison by about $750 million over the last year, an industry consultant tells the Assembly Electricity Oversight Subcommittee. ??Meanwhile, the Senate's Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market begins investigating whether electric generators artificially inflated power prices. ??An industry spokesman predicts the investigations will uncover nothing illegal. ??- The state offers financial backing to Houston-based Dynegy, which worried it would not be paid for power generated at its plants in California. Dynegy agrees to sell 300 megawatts of power from 17 small turbine generators in Carlsbad after receiving an offer from the California Department of Water Resources. ??- Gov. Gray Davis urges state regulators to approve the construction of a controversial 600-megawatt power plant in south San Jose to provide electricity to roughly 450,000 homes in the Silicon Valley. ??- The Democratic governor lobbies Senate Democrats to support his plan to pay $2.7 billion for the transmission lines owned by Southern California Edison. ??State spending on electricity has jumped by more than 50 percent since Pacific Gas and Electric Corp. declared bankruptcy April 6, thanks in part of surcharges tacked on by power generators worried they won't be repaid, Davis said. ??- The Senate Appropriations Committee sends the full Senate a bill creating a public power authority that would loan out up to $5 billion to build or buy power plants that would be required to sell electricity to consumers at low rates. ??- An Assembly committee advances a bill ending the exemption under which utility lobbyists do not have to follow the same reporting requirements as do other lobbyists. The bill now goes to the Assembly Appropriations Committee. ??- A Pacific Gas and Electric Corp. shareholder sues the company, claiming it misled shareholders by forecasting annual profits for two quarters last year when, the suit says, the company knew it was incurring losses. ??-Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch issues a statement late Wednesday, saying inaction by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission forced Southern Caifornia Edison Co. to take a large write-off of debt. \"The company should not have to shoulder these liabilities and neither should its customers,\" Lynch says. ??- Edison International's stock closes at $11.40, down 48 cents, while stock in PG&E's parent closes up 14 cents at $9.04. ??- The state remains free of power alerts as reserves stay above 7 percent. ??WHAT'S NEXT: ??- The Assembly's Energy Oversight Subcommittee plans to resume hearings Thursday in its inquiry into California's highest-in-the-nation natural gas prices with testimony from gas companies. ??- Davis' representatives continue negotiating with Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas and Electric Co., to buy the utility's transmission lines. Davis says he expects to have an agreement within two weeks. ??- The state Public Utilities Commission will decide Thursday whether to investigate why a key block of power generators is staying off-line despite regulators' order last month that they start getting paid by the state's utilities. Independent Energy Producers Executive Director Jan Smutny-Jones says the generators can't afford to operate because they are still owed more than a billion dollars, and because the PUC's rates don't cover their operating costs. ??PUC President Loretta Lynch also wants the commission to decide Thursday to investigate whether PG&E's April 6 bankruptcy protection filing is enough of a threat to the PUC's regulatory authority to prompt more PUC involvement in the bankruptcy proceedings. ??THE PROBLEM: ??High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's electricity crisis. ??Edison and PG&E say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June to high wholesale prices that the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. ??Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power costs. ??The Public Utilities Commission has raised rates up to 46 percent to help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power-buying.

The Brattle Group was hired by Edison to study the natural gas market. ??The committee is one of two legislative committees exploring whether illegal market manipulation in the electricity and natural gas markets has driven up California's energy costs. ??\"This is a market that is plagued by the exercise of market power,\" Frank Wolak, chairman of the California Independent System Operator's Market Surveillance Committee, told the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market. The ISO runs the state's power grid. ??However, \"there is no law against me saying, 'I'm not going to sell to you,\"' Wolak said. Market manipulation only becomes illegal when there is collusion, Wolak said, and such evidence is hard to find. ??Electricity generators and natural gas suppliers say a severe supply and demand imbalance - not market manipulation - has led to higher prices. ??\"Everybody's busy doing investigations. They're not interested in solving the problem,\" said Independent Energy Producers Executive Director Jan Smutny-Jones. ??Investigations \"are wasting everybody's time,\" Smutny-Jones said, adding that previous probes and lawsuits have uncovered no wrongdoing. He said the state's power problems came because state regulators denied utilities the chance to sign long-term energy contracts when they had the chance. ??\"People have been playing by the rules,\" Smutny-Jones said. ??But the Senate committee's first witnesses are ISO officials who authored studies that claim the state paid more than $6 billion too much for power last year. ??Committee chair Joseph Dunn, D-Garden Grove, also has slated state Auditor Elaine Howell, who last month blamed buyers and sellers for skyrocketing electricity costs. Dunn also has scheduled future testimony from state, federal, academic and private investigators studying the power market. ??He invited five major generators to attend the committee's second hearing next week. All five - Reliant, Dynegy, Williams Energy, Duke Energy and Mirant - say they are eager to cooperate and clear their names, Dunn said. ??Dunn asked the five for a total of 86 specific documents. If the companies feel they cannot provide documents because of legal or confidentiality concerns, Dunn said he will subpoena them. ??Smutny-Jones said investigators appear to be growing desperate to blame the state's natural gas and electricity price hikes on illegal market manipulation instead of natural market forces. ??He cited Attorney General Bill Lockyer's announcement last week that any informant who helped prove wrongdoing would be entitled to a percentage of the state's recovery he estimated could range from $50 million to hundreds of millions of dollars. ??\"If the state's offering a $50 million reward, they haven't found anything,\" Smutny-Jones said. \"I don't think you're going to find the fact that anybody did anything criminal here.\" ??Assemblywoman Jenny Oropeza, D-Long Beach, said she believes otherwise after Wednesday's testimony: \"I think it is very clear there was some price manipulation going on.\" ??But Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine, isn't sure there was anything illegal. ??\"There clearly are market forces at work, that's evident,\" Campbell said. \"Whether you make the jump to market manipulation ... I haven't seen conclusive evidence that leads me to make that jump.\" LOAD-DATE: April 19, 2001 of 5 DOCUMENTS ???????????????????The Associated Press State & Local Wire The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ?????????????????????April 18, 2001, Wednesday, BC cycle SECTION: State and Regional LENGTH: 833 words HEADLINE: Legislators probe possible power, natural gas collusion BYLINE: By DON THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Unchecked free-market forces drove up the price of natural gas to Southern California Edison by about $750 million over the last year, an industry consultant testified Wednesday. ??Paul Carpenter told the Assembly Electricity Oversight Subcommittee the price spikes came after the El Paso Natural Gas Co. contracted first with Dynegy and later with its own marketing affiliate, El Paso Merchant Energy, to control the pipeline capacity. ??The California Public Utilities Commission estimated a year ago that overcharges by the companies that control natural gas flow drove up prices by $ 100 million a year to California gas and electricity customers. ??But PUC attorney Harvey Morris said that was before last summer's price spikes, which he blamed on natural gas suppliers using a \"monopoly\" to \"game the system.\" ??\"It's way worse than we could possibly have imagined,\" Morris said after testifying before the subcommittee. \"It's obviously way higher than $100 million.\" ??Natural gas rates at the California border generally tracked national prices until November, when they spiked as high as 11 times higher than the price of natural gas elsewhere in the nation, Carpenter said. ??\"I have never seen gas prices like this anywhere in the world,\" said Carpenter, who has been studying the energy market for 20 years for Cambridge, Mass.-based consultant The Brattle Group.

LOAD-DATE: April 19, 2001 Power bloc blasts seizure idea Producers say talk of bold action fuels crisis By Steve Geissinger SACRAMENTO BUREAU ?-- Oakland Tribune SACRAMENTO -- Outraged by a report in The Oakland Tribune that some lawmakers asked the governor to seize high-priced power contracts, a key industry group Tuesday warned the Davis administration and Legislature that such action would worsen the energy crisis. \"We're publicly saying . . . this kind of rhetoric will have dire consequences on both the reliability and cost of power in California for years to come,\" said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association. \"It is the kind of rhetoric one would expect in Indonesia or the Philippines, not the sixth largest economy on the planet,\" he said in a teleconference. At the same time, Davis administration officials confirmed that seizing contracts of allegedly profiteering brokers is the most likely last-ditch move if options continue to narrow, ahead of the previously discussed concepts of seizing California power plants owned by out-of-state firms or passing a windfall profits tax. Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio pointed out the governor already seized power contracts on which California's investor-owned utilities were defaulting in early February. The state, trying to buy its way out of the energy crisis with no clear end in sight, lost a substantial measure of control over electricity prices and supplies to the courts with the recent bankruptcy filing by the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, employed hard-sell tactics Tuesday in an effort to convince reluctant Democrats that their failure to embrace his plan to financially rescue teetering Southern California Edison could plunge that utility into bankruptcy, as well. While most Republicans are flatly opposed to the plan as misguided, Democrats, who hold a majority in the Legislature, worry it's a public bailout of an investor-owned utility and would hand the state control over only Edison's south-state piece of the strategic high-voltage transmission grid in California. Soaring wholesale power costs have financially shattered utilities, forcing the state into runaway, multibillion-dollar spending that helps keep the lights on but threatens the state budget. The manager of the state's power grid has accused generators and marketers of overcharging Californians more than $6 billion in recent months. Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, said Monday that members of both legislative houses were interested in seizure of California power plants' contracts with brokers, who sell to customers within or outside the state. Sen. Don Perata, D-Oakland, an outspoken critic of the Davis administration's handling of the crisis, said some lawmakers had asked the governor to use emergency or eminent domain powers to seize the overpriced contracts and were awaiting Davis' answer this week. Supporters of the move said seizure would allow the state to control where the power is sold and decrease price markups by eliminating the middleman. But myriad questions remain unanswered, including regulatory and interstate commerce issues as well as any state reimbursement of the brokers. Any move to seize power contracts would be overturned by the courts, said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum. \"Instead of trying to do what's legally within their reach, they go to extreme measures that are on their very face unlawful and unconstitutional,\" Ackerman said. Moreover, industry officials said, seizure would not only chill industry investment in California's power system and lead to higher power costs but would be ironic since California has shunned lower-cost, long-term contracts, industry officials said. \"It would create a very unstable political, regulatory environment,\" Smutny-Jones said. \"It would have extremely adverse consequences for California in the long term.\" Even so, the talk has worried the industry. Smutny-Jones said his clients are \"very, very troubled by this sudden turn in rhetoric.\" \"I assume when senior members of the Legislature make pronouncements about potentially seizing contracts, it's designed to get our attention and we obviously take those things seriously,\" he said. The Independent Energy Producers group is \"in the process\" of contacting the Davis administration and lawmakers, said Smutny-Jones. \"You'll hear more about this.\" Copyright 2001 Copley News Service Copley News Service April 19, 2001, Thursday SECTION: State and regional LENGTH: 780 words HEADLINE: Windfall-profits tax gets Davis' backing BYLINE: Bill Ainsworth DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Federal regulators' failure to stop what they described as anti-competitive practices in the natural-gas industry added $750 million to Southern California Edison's cost of electricity, a consultant estimated yesterday. ??The consultant, Paul Carpenter of the Brattle Group, spoke to an Assembly subcommittee investigating why California pays the highest natural-gas prices in the nation. Natural gas is a critical part of the electricity crisis because most of the state's generating plants run on natural gas. ??Natural-gas prices have soared throughout the nation, but the bench mark price paid at California's border has been double that paid at other bench mark locations throughout the nation for months, according to figures released by the Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight. ??Next week, Carpenter plans to testify at hearings in Washington, D.C., on behalf of Southern California Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission, which are asking federal regulators to intervene. ??The giant utility and the state regulatory body contend that a sweetheart deal between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy gave the sister companies enough market power to artificially raise the price of natural gas that flows into Southern California from Texas. ??El Paso owns the major pipeline bringing natural gas from fields in New Mexico and Texas to Southern California. El Paso Merchant Energy is an unregulated sister company. ??Carpenter called the prices paid in Southern California ''simply unprecedented'' in the United States. He estimated that the sister companies manipulated the market enough to add $2.60 to the price of a million British thermal units of gas. ??In addition, he said, El Paso Merchant Energy owns part of 20 smaller power plants, ''qualifying facilities'' that get paid based on the price of natural gas in California. The higher natural-gas prices increase the company's revenues, Carpenter said. ??El Paso company officials are expected to testify in front of the Assembly subcommittee today, but in proceedings before the federal regulators they have denied any sweetheart deal. ??In a report they commissioned, the company blamed the higher natural-gas prices in Southern California on increased demand and constraints on pipeline capacity. ??Gov. Gray Davis, meanwhile, gave his strongest endorsement yet to a windfall-profits tax on generators as a Senate committee chaired by Joseph Dunn, D-Laguna Niguel, began a series of hearings to probe possible price gouging by generators. ??''I believe the Legislature would be well within its prerogative to insist that generators receive an appropriate reduction, whether it's 20 percent or any other number the Legislature hit upon,'' Davis said. ??Senate Democrats, Davis said, will form a special committee to help work on his plan for the state purchase of the transmission system of Southern California Edison for $2.76 billion, in exchange for state aid in paying off the utilities' debt. ??The governor said he told Senate Democrats, a number of whom are skeptical of the plan, that Edison's parent firm has agreed to back a $3 billion upgrade of the neighborhood distribution system retained by Edison and to return a $400 million tax refund to the utility. ??At the natural-gas hearing yesterday, state officials said that after El Paso Merchant Energy bought a significant part of the pipeline capacity from its sister company, it withheld natural gas to drive prices up. ??''Marketers have gamed the system and figured out how to hoard capacity and undermine competition,'' said Harvey Morris, an attorney for the California Public Utilities Commission. ??State regulators want the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates natural gas, to open the market to more competitors. ??But the commission has repeatedly rejected similar complaints in the past. On March 28, FERC ruled that the affiliates did not arrange a sweetheart deal. ??''The fact that El Paso Merchant controls a large volume of capacity does not, in and of itself, render the El Paso contracts unjust, unreasonable or unduly discriminatory,'' FERC ruled. ??In other cases involving natural gas, federal regulators acknowledged that certain contract provisions allowed anti-competitive behavior, but they approved those contracts anyway. ??Lawmakers said they were puzzled by the federal regulators' lack of action. ??''It baffles me that we've found the problem anti-competitive behavior and market gaming, but there's no cure because federal regulators won't take action,'' said Assemblyman Juan Vargas, D-San Diego.

Not going to happen, Vice President Dick Cheney insists. Don't waste your energy thinking about it. ??\"Frankly, California is looked on by many folks as a classic example of the kinds of problems that arise when you do use price caps,\" Cheney said in a telephone interview Wednesday. ??The vice president was referring to another type of price cap--the infamous state cap on consumer rates that has left the private utilities billions short of enough revenue to pay their gouging wholesalers. What political leaders in California and the Northwest are pleading for from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is a regional cap on wholesale prices. ??Early last year, a megawatt-hour was selling wholesale in California for $ 30. By year's end, it had risen to an average $ 300, according to state officials. At peak, prices have soared to $ 1,500. Meanwhile, demand increased last year by less than 4%. In fact, demand last month was 9% less than in March 2000. ??This is the sorry news for ratepayers/ taxpayers: Californians paid $ 7.4 billion for electricity in 1999. This year, the tab--without price caps--is projected at $ 70 billion. Gov. Gray Davis disclosed Tuesday that his administration has been shelling out $ 73 million a day to buy electricity for the pauper utilities. ??The profits of power producers--many of them Texans and Bush backers--have risen 400%-500%-600%. ??* ??But none of this budges the Bush administration. ??Price caps, Cheney declares, may provide \"short-term political relief for the politicians. But they don't do anything to deal with the basic fundamental problem.\" That problem is supply, he says; price caps discourage investment in new power plants and encourage consumption. ??Counters Garry South, Davis' political strategist: \"The notion by free market zanies that you have to let profits rise 500%-600% is ludicrous. Reasonable profits can be made without bankrupting the system. They're just trying to protect the profits of their friends in the energy business.\" ??In truth, California is building power plants as fast as it can. But not enough new megawatts apparently will be online by summer to prevent blackouts--and the bleeding of billions more into the pockets of out-of-state profiteers. ??How about a temporary price cap? ??\"Six months? Six years?\" Cheney replies. \"Once politicians can no longer resist the temptation to go with price caps, they usually are unable to ever muster the courage to end them . . . ??\"I don't see that as a possibility . . . Any package you can wrap it in, any fancy rhetoric you can prop it up with, it does not solve the problem.\" ??* ??The White House clearly understands it has a problem in California--a political problem. A problem with a Democratic-dominated state that voted overwhelmingly for Al Gore. And now a problem with that mythical headline--Bush to California: Drop Dead--which seems to be getting bigger each day. ??There have been several recent California: Drop Dead stories. One was in Sunday's New York Times--\"Bush Devoting Scanty Attention to California.\" Tuesday, the Sacramento Bee reported that when Cheney met with Northwest members of Congress to discuss West Coast energy, he barred Californians from the room. ??Cheney flatly denies it. ??But Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) says she has had trouble making contact with the Bush White House. She has sent two letters to President Bush asking for a meeting on energy. The first time, she got back a form letter with her name misspelled. On the second try, she got a group meeting with Cheney. ??\"It was very disappointing,\" she says. \"He spoke about letting the free market work and drilling in Alaska . That's not going to help California in the short-term. We need price caps until we're able to fix this very broken market. . . ??\"There seems no interest in really wanting to understand the California situation.\" ??I asked Cheney whether he sensed an anti-California bias across the country? \"No more than there's an anti-Texas bias,\" he replied. \"I wouldn't get paranoid about it. ??\"The fact is, California is one of the leading states in the nation. Often a trendsetter. . . . Well, we hope not to emulate your energy policy. Hopefully, we'll learn from that.\" ??His message to California: \"There's no reason not to be optimistic. The energy crunch obviously is a significant problem. . . . But it too will pass.\" ??While learning from California, the Bush White House also might take a refresher course in the free market Hoover administration.

BYLINE: JENIFER WARREN and TERENCE MONMANEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Attempting to show that no region in California is safe from sacrifice, Gov. Gray Davis on Wednesday called for quick state approval of a controversial power plant proposed for the Silicon Valley. ??The governor's action locks him in combat with the San Jose City Council, which has unanimously rejected the plant, and Cisco Systems, the computer networking giant that wants to build its worldwide headquarters on adjacent land. ??In praising the proposed plant as a model of low-polluting efficiency, Davis said all regions of California must share the pain as the state expands its power supply--a key step toward ending blackouts and reducing sky-high electricity prices. ??If approved, the plant would be the 14th licensed by the California Energy Commission since Davis took office. The 13th--a 510-megawatt plant near San Diego--was approved unanimously by the commission Wednesday with little controversy. ??Rushing to expand the state's overtaxed energy supply, the governor has recently cut in half the approval times for the licensing of some plants. Six are under construction, according to Davis, and three are scheduled to begin operation this summer. A fourth--the AES Corp. generator in Huntington Beach that is due to be restarted --could add more megawatts to the supply this summer. ??V. John White, an energy consultant in Sacramento, said the governor's newly active role as an advocate for power plants was a necessary step given the urgency of the supply shortage. ??\"It's very rare, and I wouldn't want him to short-circuit the commission's review process,\" White said. \"But I think he's trying to reassure folks we're doing everything we can and not just sitting around in our hot tubs.\" ??Davis urged the Energy Commission--a five-member panel dominated by his appointees--to stop talking about the project and grant it a license. If the commission does so, it will mark only the third time the panel has usurped a local government's authority over zoning. ??\"We are all in this together,\" Davis said, flanked by a forest of electric transformers near the Capitol. \"We are one state, and we all have to make the sacrifices necessary to make up for the mistakes of the last 12 years, when no major power plants were built.\" ??The governor said the plant's developers, Calpine Corp. and Bechtel Enterprises Holdings Inc., have made \"numerous concessions\" to San Jose officials, including an agreement to sell power exclusively in the region. ??He added that the $ 300-million plant--expected to supply about 450,000 homes--will be equipped with state-of-the-art systems that make it \"one of the cleanest plants to go up in the nation.\" ??The commission's staff has recommended licensing the project, and some analysts said the governor's intervention--said to be unprecedented--should fuel momentum for approval. ??Commissioner Robert Laurie--one of two members who held evidentiary hearings on the project and is preparing a recommendation for the full commission--would not comment on the plant's prospects. But Laurie, an appointee of former Gov. Pete Wilson, insisted that the project would receive an impartial review. ??\"I know the importance of independent decision-making,\" he said. ??San Jose officials say the Calpine project conflicts with the aesthetics of its site in a bucolic valley 15 miles south of downtown. On Wednesday, Mayor Ron Gonzales urged the Energy Commission to \"give serious attention\" to the city's concerns about the plant's potential impact on residents and the environment. ??\"As the project has been designed and proposed to operate . . . it would present an unfair burden to our community,\" the mayor said. ??A spokeswoman for the Calpine/Bechtel partnership disagreed and characterized the plant as key to restoring energy stability in the Silicon Valley, a region heavily dependent on imported power. ??\"This is the only project in the pipeline that can help Silicon Valley out of its predicament in the near future,\" said the spokeswoman, Lisa Poelle. ??She expressed hope that the governor's comments, which cap numerous meetings between the partnership staff and Davis aides, would encourage San Jose to soften its stance on the project. ??The 600-megawatt plant is proposed for a swath of open space currently leased to a rancher and occupied by grazing cattle. A preliminary ruling by Laurie and the other commissioner scrutinizing the project is expected by June. The full commission would take a final vote about a month later, and if a license were granted, the plant would begin operations sometime in 2003. ??From the beginning, the plant has been dogged by opposition, and the Energy Commission has held more than 20 hearings--an unusually large number--on its fate. ??On Wednesday, a spokesman for its heftiest foe, San Jose-based Cisco, said the company still has serious concerns about \"health and safety issues.\" ??Cisco has strongly opposed the plant because the company wants to build a $ 1.3-billion headquarters for 20,000 employees nearby. In the past, Cisco officials have threatened to relocate to another state if the power plant is built. ??Company spokesman Steve Langdon said the firm's plans to build an industrial campus were not scuttled by the announcement Monday that it is cutting 8,500 workers from its payroll because of slumping sales of its Internet networking equipment. ??But he suggested that the plans were flexible enough to be scaled down for a smaller work force and that the campus may not house the company's headquarters. ??\"It doesn't all get built at once,\" he said. \"We will build and occupy the site over time in phases as needed.\" ??Another leading opponent of the power plant argued Wednesday that the Energy Commission lacks authority to override San Jose officials and license the project. The Santa Teresa Citizen Action Group, launched by homeowners near the site, says the commission may only take such a step if a better plant site hasn't been identified. ??The group charges that the commission is aware of other available sites, including one in an industrial part of the East Bay area, and lists eight other reasons the plant should not be built, among them the noise and emissions it would produce. ??The local Sierra Club chapter, however, has endorsed the plant largely on grounds that it would run cleaner than existing plants in the area. By offsetting emissions from those older plants, the new project would actually reduce air pollution, said Kurt Newick of the Sierra Club's Loma Prieta chapter. ??On another front, Davis continued to lobby legislators for support for his plan to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy through purchase of the utility's transmission grid. ??Emerging from lunch with state Senate Democrats who are openly wary of the deal, Davis said he'd made progress to \"bridge some of the gaps.\" It was the governor's third meeting in two days with lawmakers of both parties. ??Some of the toughest skeptics are members of his own party in the Senate. Many fear that the deal Davis struck with Edison will hand the utility too much at the expense of ratepayers, and some say bankruptcy might be a better option for the state's second-largest private utility. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy April 6. ??To assuage concerns, Davis proposed that a special Senate committee be named to meet with his energy advisors as the administration and Edison finalize details of the deal before it goes to the Legislature for approval. ??Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco), who has called the Edison agreement \"problematic,\" said he may appoint such a committee but continued to suggest that an Edison bankruptcy might be acceptable. ??\"Many of the Fortune 100 companies have gone into Chapter 11 bankruptcy and it ain't like the end of the world for anybody,\" Burton said. ??* ??Times staff writer Carl Ingram contributed to this story. ??Powering Up California ??Power plant projects recently licensed by the California Energy Commission and when they are expected to go online: ??* ??* Two of four turbines are expected to go online in December 2001; the other two are expected to go online in March 2002. ??Source: California Energy Commission GRAPHIC: PHOTO: (2 photos) Gov.

Consequently, its customers' power rates are expected to be stable this year while Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers face huge rate increases. ???But municipal utilities such as Alameda's are still part of the statewide power grid, which is managed by the Independent System Operator, and are subject to rolling blackouts like everybody else when the state's energy reserves dip below 1.5 percent. ???Each of Alameda's four diesel generators will produce 1.5 megawatts of power. Each megawatt can light up 1,000 homes, utility officials say. ???The units, leased at a total cost of $68,000 a month through the end of the year, are parked at Alameda Point. ???Their cost will be paid through the municipal utility's reserve fund and customers' power bills won't be affected, said Junona Jonas, the utility's general manager. ???\"I think in the long run, we'll see more supply in the state, but until that happens, there will be communities that'll have to take these short-term drastic measures,\" Jonas said. ???The utility's spokesman, Matthew McCabe, said the diesel exhaust from the generators won't be an environmental factor. ???\"Our environmental record is extremely important to us,\" McCabe said. \"The diesel generators are only for emergency backup. . . . Besides, these things are clean -- it's not like standing next to a diesel bus.\" ???The city is also getting help from the U.S. Maritime Administration, which operates more than a dozen ships at the former Navy station in Alameda. When the juice is low, those ships will unplug from the port and use onboard generators, Jonas said. ???In the North Bay, Healdsburg officials are waiting for the arrival of two diesel generators. Combined, they are expected to produce 3.5 megawatts of power, which can account for about 20 percent of the city's expected summer peak load, said Bill Duarte, city utility director. ???\"We're taking matters into our own hands,\" he said. ???Farther south, both Santa Clara and Palo Alto are considering leasing portable generators, officials said. ???Bill Reichmann, senior electric utility engineer at Santa Clara's Silicon Valley Power, said the utility is planning to lease eight generators, operating them in the southeastern end of town near the San Jose International Airport. ???Palo Alto's municipal utility also has recommended that the City Council approve renting two generators starting next month, said spokeswoman Rima Johnson.E-mail Matthew Yi at myi@sfchronicle.com.

Gray Davis' assertion that the state is being gouged by power companies because of PG&E's bankruptcy filing. ???Such dissent from the governor's own subordinates could make it harder for Davis to gain support for his energy measures in the state Legislature. ???Despite Davis' latest claims, the Department of Water Resources, which is spending about $70 million a day buying power, said there is no evidence linking recent price increases to Pacific Gas and Electric Co. filing for bankruptcy protection on April 6. ???\"It is a seller's market,\" said Viju Patel, executive manager of the Department of Water Resources' power systems department. \"The power companies do not need an excuse to raise prices.\" ???Critics say Davis' penchant for secrecy on energy issues has come back to haunt him at a time when he needs all the allies he can find. ???\"People aren't taking his words at face value,\" said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. ???Republican lawmakers -- and even some Democrats -- have challenged a number of the governor's initiatives, including a multibillion-dollar bailout scheme for Southern California Edison. ???Nevertheless, Davis reiterated his belief yesterday that recent electricity price increases are \"an aberration driven by the bankruptcy of PG&E.\" ???He said California's spending on power jumped 40 percent in the week following PG&E's bankruptcy filing because generators say they face a greater risk of not being paid. ???\"Nothing else in the equation has changed,\" said Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor. \"Everything is the same except the bankruptcy.\" ???However, power companies were quick to challenge this assertion. They insisted that PG&E's bankruptcy actually was seen as a positive development by those in the energy business. ???\"If anything, PG&E provides some solace for traders because the bankruptcy provides an organized mechanism for recovery of payments,\" said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a Menlo Park energy-industry association. ???On the other hand, he acknowledged that power companies are becoming increasingly wary of the state of California's creditworthiness as an energy buyer. ???The Department of Water Resources already has spent nearly $5 billion buying electricity and has yet to recoup a dime from ratepayers. State regulators are still trying to come up with a way to apportion the limited revenues from power rates among the various parties in California's energy picture. ???Rating agency Fitch Inc. said yesterday it may cut the state's credit rating because of questions surrounding recovery of energy costs. ???\"People are keeping an eye on things,\" Ackerman said. \"They're watching how California finances things.\" ???If a premium on electricity sales to the state exists, he said it probably has been in place since the beginning of the year, well before PG&E's current woes. ???UCAN's Shames agreed. He said power companies added a \"risk premium\" to their California power sales late last year when it looked like the state's energy troubles were worsening. ???\"PG&E's bankruptcy may have increased the uncertainty,\" Shames said, \"but we've been paying a risk premium for months now.\" ???Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant Energy in Houston, insisted that his company's traders are not using questions about PG&E's or California's financial solvency as a fresh excuse for higher prices. ???\"I haven't seen any evidence of it,\" he said. ???Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Houston's Enron Corp., laid blame for recent price increases on low rainfall throughout the West, which has cut output at hydroelectric facilities, as well as on California's chronic power shortage. ???\"It's not that there's a premium on prices,\" he said. \"It's just supply and demand.\" ???That said, Palmer acknowledged that California's firm insistance on blackouts being avoided at all costs leaves the state vulnerable to virtually any price generators choose to demand. ???\"This means prices will be used to allocate a scarce resource,\" he said. \"There's no other way it could work.\" ???Bottom line for consumers: It's going to be a long, hot summer, and electricity prices will soar even higher as demand surges. ???And despite the best efforts of state officials, a daily threat of blackouts remains a virtual certainty as California's beleaguered power grid is stretched to the breaking point. ???At the Department of Water Resources' command center in a Sacramento shopping mall, the state's team of electricity traders has moved onto a new, high-tech trading floor, where they negotiate power deals each day from the crack of dawn. ???The department's Patel said daily blackouts may be averted this summer after consumers see skyrocketing power prices reflected in their bills. ???\"People will respond to these prices and they are going to conserve like never before,\" Patel predicted.E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com.

Gray Davis urged the state Energy Commission yesterday to approve a controversial power plant in San Jose, saying California needs every megawatt it can harness. ???Davis' recommendation runs counter to the wishes of the San Jose City Council and Mayor Ron Gonzales, who have come out against the 600-megawatt Metcalf Energy Center in south San Jose's Coyote Valley. It also puts the governor at odds with one of his political allies, Cisco Systems chief John Chambers, whose company opposes the plant because it would be built near the tech firm's proposed new campus. ???Davis' announcement came the same day he all but admitted he lacks the support he needs in the state Senate for the deal he reached with Southern California Edison to restore the utility to financial health. Davis has portrayed that deal and construction of new power plants as essential to making California's energy market functional again. ???\"I think when we have an opportunity to put more power on line we should seize it,\" Davis said. \"I believe we spend too much time talking about Metcalf. It's time to start building it.\" ???The Energy Commission has been reviewing the proposal by Calpine Corp. and Bechtel Enterprises Inc. for months. The commission's staff recommended in October that the plant be built, and a final decision is expected by summer. If it is approved, the plant could come on line next year and provide enough electricity for 600,000 homes. ???None of the five commissioners could be reached yesterday. Three are Democrats appointed by Davis and two are Republicans appointed by former Gov. Pete Wilson. ???Gonzales and the rest of the City Council rejected the Metcalf plant in November. Until yesterday, Davis had sat on the sidelines as the energy crisis deepened and a long line of state and federal officials, including four of the five Assembly members from Silicon Valley, urged the commission to overturn the council's vote. ???Some neighborhood groups oppose the plant, along with computer networking giant Cisco, which hopes to build a 20,000-worker campus on a neighboring parcel. Cisco chief Chambers donated $50,000 to Davis in the first six months of last year. ???Cisco's reaction yesterday was restrained. ???\"We have great respect for the governor and respect his decision,\" said Cisco spokesman Steve Langdon. ???However, Langdon added: \"We still have serious concerns about health and safety issues related to the proposed power plant.\" ???Some neighbors were much angrier. ???\"He's trying to act like he's the big, bad tough governor, and he's spineless,\" said Issa Ajlouny, who lives in the Santa Teresa neighborhood, less than a mile from the proposed plant. \"He knows the approval process isn't working in his favor, so he's trying to come out and act like a hero to the state of California. But he's nothing but backstabbing the city of San Jose on the environmental issues.\" ???Supporters of the plant see the 14 acres of former junkyard as the perfect site -- right next to Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s largest substation in the South Bay, close to major transmission lines and shielded from its neighbors by a 350-foot hill. ???But a housing development is also nearby, and residents fear the power plant will belch pollutants in an area already suffering from some of the worst air quality in the Bay Area. ???Mayor Gonzales continued to express his concern yesterday. ???\"I would support clean power plants that will help us achieve greater energy self-sufficiency for San Jose residents and business,\" Gonzales said. \"As the Metcalf project has been designed and proposed to operate, however, it would present an unfair burden on our community.\" ???That's not what Davis said, however, calling Metcalf \"one of the cleanest, most efficient plants in the country.\" ???Davis praised the efforts of Calpine/Bechtel to work with the local community and said he was especially pleased that the venture had agreed to commit all the power to the local region. ???\"The Silicon Valley is obviously the engine driving our economy, but they are very dependent on outside power,\" Davis said. ???Also in Sacramento yesterday, after an hourlong session with Senate Democrats -- the toughest legislative sell for Davis' proposed Edison deal -- the governor all but admitted his plan could not win enough votes for Senate approval. ???\"I think he knew there weren't enough votes going in,\" said Sen.

Vancouver Sun ????????????????????April 19, 2001 Thursday FINAL EDITION SECTION: BUSINESS, Pg. F1 / Front LENGTH: 731 words HEADLINE: B.C. Hydro's credit to California firms exceeded 1999 guidelines BYLINE: David Baines SOURCE: Vancouver Sun BODY: ??A confidential document issued in late 1999 shows that B.C. Hydro's power-trading subsidiary, Powerex, set a credit limit of $100 million US for its California customers. ??However, by the end of 2000, Powerex had extended three times that amount of credit to those customers -- the California Independent System Operator and the California Power Exchange. With the California Power Exchange and Cal-ISO's major customer, Pacific Gas & Electric, under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, repayment of this debt is now in doubt. ??Powerex spokesman Wayne Cousins noted that the document obtained by The Vancouver Sun, which is marked \"strictly confidential,\" was issued in November 1999. ??\"That's an old copy of our risk-management policy,\" he said in an interview Wednesday. ??\"Credit limits have changed since then based on careful assessment of several factors including market conditions, risks, maintaining long-standing relationships and helping California meet its electricity needs to prevent crisis situations. ??\"Temporary revisions were only implemented after very diligent review incorporating the best market intelligence available, our own due diligence and on-going dialogue with appropriate market participants.\" ??He refused to say when the credit limits for Cal-ISO and the California Power Exchange were increased. ??\"That type of information is confidential. You have a copy that, I assume, was leaked in some way, but this is commercially confidential information.\" ??He said the increase in credit limits helped B.C. Hydro achieve record net income of about $1 billion during the year ending March 31. This figures does not include any write-downs that may occur if Powerex determines that any of its customer accounts are not collectible. ??Cousins, however, was insistent that all debts will be collected: \"We continue to pursue monies owing and we expect to be paid for electricity we have sold.\" ??He noted that Powerex suspended trades to all California entities on Dec. 8 unless those trades were fully secured by creditworthy customers. ??By that time, Cal-ISO and California had racked up an unpaid bill of about $ 300 million US, or $475 million Cdn -- about half the net income that Hydro has tentatively reported for the year ending March 31. ??The confidential document states that Powerex's policies and procedures are designed to control \"the risk of financial loss due to changes in market prices or volatility\" and \"the risk that a counterparty (customer) in a commodity transaction defaults on delivery and/or settlement.\" ??It states that the amount of credit to be advanced to any customer depends on its credit rating. An \"AAA\" customer, for example, may be granted credit to a maximum of $20 million. ??Cal-ISO and California Power Exchange are not utilities, they are power pools. They purchase power from Powerex and other suppliers and re-sell it to utilities such as Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison. ??The pools are not rated, but are assigned specific credit limits. As of November 1999, Cal-ISO had a credit limit of $40 million US and the California Power Exchange $60 million US. ??The risk-management document notes that the credit-worthiness of these pools depends on that of its suppliers. ??\"The Powerex credit-risk manager and the treasury manager are responsible for initially evaluating, and then monitoring, the credit-authorization policies and credit limits for each power pool in which Powerex trades,\" the document states. \"Significant alterations in the credit policies of a power pool will trigger a mandatory reappraisal of the power-pool credit limit.\" ??California has been caught in a power vice in recent months. The problem dates back to 1996, when the state developed a plan to deregulate the electricity business. Competition was supposed to lower rates below a price cap that had been imposed. ??However, dry conditions cut the ability to generate hydro-electric power and a surge in the state's economy created unprecedented demand for electricity. Prices soared. ??The result was that the California utilities paid record prices for power, but weren't allowed to pass along the full cost to consumers. ??Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, the state's two biggest utilities, now owe about $12 billion. ??dbaines@pacpress.southam.ca TYPE: Business LOAD-DATE: April 19, 2001 of 63 DOCUMENTS ???????????????????The Associated Press State & Local Wire The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ?????????????????????April 18, 2001, Wednesday, BC cycle SECTION: Business News LENGTH: 348 words HEADLINE: Williams again target of overcharging allegations from federal regulators DATELINE: TULSA, Okla. BODY: ??Federal regulators are once against targeting Williams for allegedly overcharging Californians for electricity. ??The Tulsa-based energy company was cited in a notice this week from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for allegedly overcharging California customers $25,574 in March. ??Two other companies were also cited in the notice from federal regulators Monday. ??Dynegy Power Marketing Inc. of Houston was cited for overcharging California customers $469,662, while Mirant California LLC, of Atlanta, was cited for overcharges of $92,620. ??The commission told Williams and the other two companies to either refund the money or justify their prices, which exceeded a price of $300 per megawatt hour that was set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission because of the California's electricity shortage. ??Williams also was accused of excessive charges of $8 million in January and $ 21.6 million in February, for a total of $29.6 million. ??Williams spokeswoman Paula Hall-Collins said while the overpricing allegations against Williams in March were not as significant as in the other months, the process of justifying them will be the same as in previous months. ??\"They determine the price that they feel is fair and justifiable, and then we come back and say why we charged what we did,\" she said. ??Hall-Collins said federal regulators haven't said whether they are satisfied with how Williams justified its alleged overcharges from previous months. ??Also in March, the commission accused Williams and AES Southland of generating less power to drive up electricity prices in May and June 2000, resulting in alleged overcharging of $10.8 million. ??Williams denies overcharging for electricity it provides. ??In other news, Williams Express Inc., a unit of Williams, announced Tuesday it was selling 198 MAPCO Express convenience stores to Israel-based Delek Group for $147 million. Most of the stores are in Tennessee and executives expect to close the deal by the end of May. ??Williams will keep 29 MAPCO stores in Alaska.

BODY: ??Gov. Mike Johanns and Rep. Lee Terry, R-Neb., said Wednesday they will be working to make sure national leaders understand Nebraska's stance on a national energy policy. ??Nebraska's unique status as the only 100 percent public power state in the nation and its reliance on the corn-based fuel additive ethanol make the state's input in the development of national energy policy important, Johanns said. ??\"Public power has worked very well for Nebraska consumers by providing low cost electricity,\" he said, adding that the deregulated state of California has suffered through weeks of rolling blackouts. \"We are committed to protecting public power in this environment of deregulation.\" ??Terry said he has talked at length to the staff of Vice President Dick Cheney, who has been tapped to come up with a national energy policy draft. That draft will end up before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, on which Terry serves. ??\"There will be a discussion about a national deregulation policy,\" Terry said. ??A national deregulation policy would threaten Nebraska's public power system, Terry and Johanns said. Terry said he plans to push for a states' rights exemption to any such policy. ??\"It is absolutely necessary that Nebraska have a voice in that discussion,\" Terry said. ??Terry said he also has pleaded with the Bush administration not to grant a request from California to wave the Clean Air Act's gasoline oxygen requirement. ??Such a move is considered a death knell to ethanol, a clean-air fuel additive, because other states would be expected to follow suit in requesting - and receiving - similar waivers, thereby destroying ethanol's market. ??\"They did not telegraph their position on the waiver,\" Terry said of White House, which is expected to decide on California's request this spring. ??Other energy concerns Nebraska leaders hope to address are rising heating costs and gasoline prices, which are expected to top $2 a gallon in Nebraska this summer.

Gray Davis is expected to announce today his support for Calpine Corp.'s proposed South San Jose power plant -- a move that could ensure the state's most controversial power project is built. ??Davis said for months that he would not interfere in the environmental review of the proposed 600-megawatt power plant. But a source close to the governor said Davis has decided to use Calpine's Coyote Valley project to send a signal that California is ready to build more power plants and is \"open to business.\" ??San Jose has strenuously opposed the power plant. But Davis' decision to urge the California Energy Commission to approve it would likely hold sway with the agency, which has authority over where plants are located but has almost never overridden local opposition. ??The commission -- three of whose five members were appointed by Davis -- is expected to complete its environmental review and make a decision early this summer. ??A spokesman for the governor declined to confirm the endorsement. But late Tuesday, the governor scheduled a press conference for this morning to make an \"important energy generation announcement.\" ??San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales declined to comment. But another of the plant's leading opponents pledged to keep fighting what would be the South Bay's largest power plant. ??An endorsement from Davis would cap a stunning turnaround for the project. ??Five months ago, Calpine's Metcalf Energy Center was unanimously rejected by the San Jose City Council, which decided that the power plant would be incompatible with the city's plans to develop high-tech campuses in North Coyote Valley. ??Some Calpine officials even considered giving up plans to build the power plant. ??But as California's energy woes intensified, the Metcalf plant increasingly became a poster child for the need for more power generation to reduce the skyrocketing cost of electricity and avoid rolling blackouts. Silicon Valley, one of the state's largest electricity consumers, produces only a fraction of the energy it uses. ??Despite fierce opposition from local residents concerned about the environmental effects of a large power plant, a steady stream of state and local organizations lined up behind the project, including the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group, the San Jose Silicon Valley Chamber of Commerce and the local chapters of the Sierra Club and American Lung Association. ??The California Assembly voted unanimously in February to urge the energy commission to override San Jose and license the power plant. ??And top officials and attorneys at the energy commission have been working for months to ensure that the project wins approval, a Mercury News investigation of the commission's environmental review of the project showed. The officials undermined negative environmental assessments of the Metcalf site and silenced commission analysts who said other sites would be better. ??The energy commissioners are weighing the staff's recommendation to approve the plant. ??Commissioner Robert A. Laurie, who oversaw hearings on the project, insisted at one hearing two months ago that the commission would complete an independent review. ??Although Davis has stressed his efforts to speed construction of new power plants, the governor insisted he would not take a position on the project. ??\"The governor has repeatedly said he wants the process to play out,\" Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio said last week. \"The governor believes the energy commission should complete its review.\" ??But there have been growing signs that Davis would throw his weight behind Calpine's project. ??A senior energy commission official said aides to the governor have been calling the commission for months to urge quick approval of the Metcalf plant. The governor's press secretary said no calls have been made. ??When Davis was looking for a backdrop to hold a press conference earlier this year to announce his plans to speed up approval of new power plants, he chose Calpine's new plant in Sutter. ??The company also has actively campaigned for the governor's support. ??Earlier this year, Calpine offered to sell the state cheaper power from the plant if it is approved. ??When Calpine and its development partner Bechtel Enterprises were looking for a lobbyist in Sacramento, the companies turned to Platinum Advisors, whose president, Darius Anderson, was finance chairman of Davis' 1998 gubernatorial campaign. ??The San Jose-based company gave the governor $ 19,000 last year, according to state campaign finance reports. ??Maviglio said the governor's ties to Calpine are no different from his relationship with Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers, who has opposed the power plant. Campaign finance reports show Chambers gave Davis $ 50,000 last year. ??Calpine officials said Tuesday they did not know of the governor's impending announcement. But they said they were not surprised. \"We've been working with the governor on a number of issues,\" said project manager Ken Abreu. \"Metcalf is just one of them.\" ??Meanwhile, Calpine's opponents in San Jose City Hall and in the neighborhood nearest the proposed power plant appear more isolated than at any time since the contentious debate over the Metcalf site began more than two years ago. ??Mayor Gonzales refused to comment on Davis' planned announcement. \"I don't respond to rumors,\" said the mayor, who has helped lead opposition to Metcalf. \"I have not heard anything. If he makes a statement, I'll respond.\" ??But one of Calpine's fiercest local opponents said the nearby Santa Teresa neighborhood will continue to fight. \"We have a strong case,\" said longtime South San Jose resident Issa Ajlouny. \"And we will win.\" ??The Mercury News strives to avoid use of unnamed sources. When unnamed sources are used because information cannot otherwise be obtained, the newspaper generally requires more than one source to confirm the information. ??By Noam Levey and Mark Gladstone.

Howard News Service 18, 2001, Wednesday SECTION: DOMESTIC NEWS LENGTH: 588 words HEADLINE: Davis says Edison agreement may need altering SOURCE: Scripps-McClatchy Western Service BYLINE: EMILY BAZAR and KEVIN YAMAMURA DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif. BODY: ??Gov. Gray Davis indicated Wednesday that he may need to alter the agreement to purchase Southern California Edison's transmission lines if he wants legislators to approve the deal. ??Though the Democratic governor declined to discuss particulars, he said he asked Senate leaders to appoint a special committee dedicated to resolving disagreements between the administration and lawmakers. ??Many provisions of the memorandum of understanding, the document that lays out the terms of the Edison deal, must be approved by the Legislature and the state Public Utilities Commission. ??\"There is a determination to try and solve this problem whether or not it means amending the MOU or trying a slightly different approach,\" Davis said after meeting with Senate Democrats. ??A spokesman for the utility declined to comment on the governor's statements. ??Davis announced the Edison agreement April 9, just three days after Pacific Gas & Electric Co. unexpectedly cut off transmission line negotiations with the governor and filed for bankruptcy protection. ??The deal would require the state to pay $2.76 billion for Edison's transmission lines, or 2.3 times book value. In addition, a portion of consumer electricity rates would be dedicated to paying off the remainder of the utility's debt, estimated at about $5 billion. ??Both Edison and PG&E stockpiled massive debt when wholesale electricity prices soared. Price caps prevented them from passing along the entire cost of electricity to consumers. ??Since the Edison deal was announced, however, legislators have been critical of certain provisions, suggesting that California consumers will receive little in return for relieving the utility of billions of dollars in debt. ??\"It's clear that the deal, as is, could well be problematic,\" said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco. \"This has to do with what's in the bill, what's in it for the people of the state.\" ??Lawmakers initially believed they would have little ability to change the agreement, and referred to it as a \"take it or leave it\" deal. ??In fact, the memorandum of understanding itself says the deal can be nullified \"in the event any law is passed, adopted or repealed ... (which) would materially impede or frustrate the ability of the Parties to effectuate all of the elements of the plan as a package.\" ??But in his meeting with Senate Democrats, Davis indicated he may be willing to compromise. His goal, he said, is to keep Edison from following PG&E into bankruptcy. ??\"We still have some work to do,\" Davis said. \"I think the appointment of a special Senate committee, assuming that happens, will let us work through the detail in an appropriate fashion.\" ??Burton said he has not decided whether to appoint a committee. ??Other senators came out of the meeting guardedly optimistic that they could compromise with the governor. ??\"It was obvious that there were concerns from members,\" said Sen. Don Perata, D-Alameda. \"He is open and ready to have the proposal perfected as it moves through the legislative process.\" ??Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, said she hopes to amend the deal to ensure power generators are penalized for over-charging the utilities and the state for electricity. ??\"The way it's presently crafted, (generators) are being rewarded,\" she said. \"They are getting a premium for selling electricity at a higher premium than ever conceived of by humankind.\" ??(Contact Emily Bazar and Kevin Yamamura of the Sacramento Bee in California at http://www.sacbee.com.)

And Gov. Gray Davis announced a proposed=20 solution to one vexing problem: the utilities' failure to pay the state's= =20 small, alternative power generators, many of whom have stopped producing=20 power as a result. ?????Davis called the utilities \"shameful\" for failing to pay, and praised= =20 the alternative power generators, which include solar, wind and geothermal= =20 energy producers, as \"good corporate citizens\" who produced power although= =20 they weren't being paid. ?????\"We are anxious to pay the [small producers], who are dropping like=20 flies,\" Davis said. ?????Despite the progress, it was hard for some people to look on the brigh= t=20 side after enduring outages that took place when the state's hunger for pow= er=20 was almost 50% less than at its summer peak. ?????\"This is a taste, almost like an appetizer, of a really unpalatable me= al=20 that's going to be served up this summer,\" said Michael Shames of the Utili= ty=20 Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, himself a victim of a rolling=20 blackout that hit his office in San Diego early Tuesday. ?????Power officials have warned that this could be a grim summer in=20 California, since demand for electricity sharply rises when people turn on= =20 air conditioners. The state has been struggling to meet its power needs in= =20 recent months because of rising prices and a flawed deregulation plan that= =20 has left the two biggest private utilities on the brink of bankruptcy. Stat= e=20 leaders have so far failed to agree on a comprehensive plan to solve the=20 problems. Wally Quirk teaches a business class in a borrowed classroom Tuesday at=20 Sonoma State after the state's rolling blackouts cut the power to his usual= =20 classroom, which does not have any windows. SCOTT MANCHESTER / The Press Democrat ?????The latest round of blackouts began about 9:30 a.m. Tuesday when the= =20 California Independent System Operator, which runs the statewide grid,=20 determined that the demand for electricity was 500 megawatts more than the= =20 supply--an imbalance that meant the state was short on the power needed to= =20 supply electricity to about 375,000 homes. ?????Grid operators blamed a confluence of events, including warmer weather= ;=20 outages at several major power plants, including one unit of the San Onofre= =20 nuclear power station; a reduction in imports from the Pacific Northwest, a= nd=20 the shutdown of many alternative energy producers. Similar blackouts Monday= =20 were the first since January. ?????The situation improved somewhat by late Tuesday morning, with some=20 supplies restored and Californians conserving energy, and Cal-ISO was able = to=20 halt the rolling blackouts at 2 p.m. ?????Once again, customers of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power= =20 were spared, although the municipally owned utility said its electrical=20 surplus was smaller than usual. The DWP, like Southern California Edison, w= as=20 affected by an outage at the huge Mohave power plant in Nevada, as well as = by=20 planned outages at several of its facilities. ?????As in the past, by far the biggest impact was felt by customers served= =20 by Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility, which cut power to= =20 438,000 homes and businesses. ?????Edison cut power to 47,462 customers in about 40 cities, but eventuall= y=20 was able to avoid blackouts by shutting off the air conditioners of some of= =20 the 118,500 customers who participate in a voluntary cutoff program. ?????San Diego Gas & Electric cut power to 73,400 customers. ?????Innovative Ways of Coping ?????As on Monday, most people took the outages in stride, as an annoying b= ut=20 ultimately unavoidable inconvenience. ?????In Palmdale, four schools lost power during one of the hourlong=20 blackouts, but teachers and students pressed on in the sunlight pouring=20 through windows and skylights. At Barrel Springs Elementary, Principal Cruz= =20 Earls said the biggest problem came when students had to go to the bathroom= :=20 Hand in hand, they made their way through darkened hallways with flashlight= s. ?????All in all, it wasn't a terrible experience. Then again, the weather= =20 wasn't that hot Tuesday, with a high of 79 in Palmdale, so the shutdown of= =20 air conditioners wasn't much of a hardship. \"I don't want to think about th= e=20 conditions this could create in May or June,\" Earls said. ?????Businesses of all kinds complained about the lack of warning for the= =20 outages--and sometimes found innovative ways to get around the problem. ?????Rattled by news reports of Monday's rolling blackouts, El Burrito=20 Mexican Food Products in the city of Industry started its Tuesday shift at = 2=20 a.m. to beat the clock in the event of an outage. That hunch paid off.=20 Workers had just finished cooking and packaging the last batches of salsa a= nd=20 masa when the lights went out at 10:20 a.m. ?????Company owner Mark Roth said the firm will continue working odd hours = to=20 avoid further outages. But he isn't buying the line from the utilities that= =20 they can't provide advance warning because of concerns about looting and=20 rioting. ?????\"We're ready to do whatever it takes to get through this thing,\" he=20 said. \"But they've got to give us some notification.\" ?????At Big O Tires in Elk Grove, just south of Sacramento, owner Daniel Cr= um=20 had his 14 workers take an early lunch break or head to the warehouse to=20 reorganize the goods. Without electricity, they couldn't repair brakes or= =20 align front ends. ?????\"I'd never let them be idle,\" said Crum. ?????At least two minor traffic accidents were blamed on the outages. ?????The blackouts resulted from a convergence of factors. ?????Demand was slightly higher than expected, probably because of=20 unseasonably warm weather. Supplies were tighter than usual, in part becaus= e=20 of several outages, including that at the Mohave plant, half of which was= =20 brought back on line by the end of the day. ?????The San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station was still limping along=20 without power from one of its two 1,100-megawatt units, which was shut down= =20 Feb. 3 after a half-hour fire in a nonnuclear part of the plant. Edison,=20 which operates San Onofre, initially estimated the unit would be out for=20 several weeks but recently said \"extensive damage\" to parts of the turbine= =20 will keep the unit out of commission until mid-June. ?????Shipments from the drought-stricken Pacific Northwest, which generates= =20 most of its electricity from large dams, were also down. ?????\"Each time we take a measurement, we're closer to the all-time record= =20 for the driest year,\" said Dulcy Mahar, spokeswoman for the Bonneville Powe= r=20 Administration, the network of federal dams that provides the region with= =20 much of its electricity. \"We've been doing what we can, but we simply don't= =20 have power to sell.\" ?????Finally, there was the problem of the small and alternative energy=20 producers, which have shut down plants because they haven't been paid by th= e=20 private utilities since November. Those outages have cost the state about= =20 3,000 megawatts of electricity, enough for about 2.3 million homes. ?????\"You're seeing the system freeze up,\" said David Sokol, chairman and C= EO=20 of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co., which runs eight geothermal plants in t= he=20 Imperial Valley through its subsidiary, CalEnergy. His company hasn't shut= =20 down yet, but Sokol said smaller companies couldn't continue to sell their= =20 energy to utilities for free. ?????\"Why should we fund Edison?\" he asked. \"That's just ridiculous.\" ?????A Choice of 2 Rate Plans ?????Davis joined lawmakers in the Capitol on Tuesday to outline his plan t= o=20 get the producers running again. He said utilities have had no right to=20 collect money from ratepayers and then not use the funds to repay the small= =20 producers. The state has spent billions to buy power from large conventiona= l=20 producers on behalf of the utilities but has refused to pick up the tab for= =20 alternative energy. ?????\"The utilities acted in a shameful manner by putting money in their=20 pockets that was designed to pay the [small producers],\" Davis said. ?????The plan outlined by Davis would allow the generators to choose betwee= n=20 two rate plans. They could decide to be paid 7.9 cents per kilowatt-hour ov= er=20 five years or 6.9 cents a kilowatt-hour over 10 years. ?????The utilities must begin paying the generators the new rates beginning= =20 April 1 or face fines, Davis said. ?????The question of how the companies will get paid the about $1.5 billion= =20 they are owed remains unresolved. That issue will be decided in coming week= s=20 as Davis' negotiators continue to work on rescue plans for the state's=20 financially hobbled private utilities. ?????PG&E spokesman Ron Low said the state's largest utility did not take= =20 kindly to Davis' criticism, and noted that the governor's plan is similar t= o=20 a proposal that PG&E made last week to producers. ?????Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of a trade group that includes so= me=20 of the small generators, described the plan as a positive step. ?????\"The governor got it right in that it's not acceptable for small power= =20 producers to continue to generate and not be paid,\" Smutny-Jones said. \"But= =20 we'll need to see what the order says; the devil will truly be in the=20 details.\" ?????Grid operators said the state's overall energy situation eased by midd= ay=20 Tuesday because of repairs at the Mohave plant and another large plant at= =20 Ormond Beach, and because the Western Area Power Administration came up wit= h=20 300 megawatts of electricity from Glen Canyon Dam. ?????Also, grid spokesman Patrick Dorinson said conservation savings spiked= =20 upward after earlier complaints that Californians weren't conserving. ?????\"We saw the people of California probably conserve 900 megawatts today= ,\"=20 he said. \"That was probably the difference.\" ---=20 ?????Times staff writers Andrew Blankstein, Jose Cardenas, Marla Dickerson,= =20 Noaki Schwartz, Nicholas Riccardi, Doug Smith, Rebecca Trounson and Richard= =20 Winton in Los Angeles, Miguel Bustillo and Julie Tamaki in Sacramento, Mari= a=20 La Ganga in San Francisco, Stanley Allison, Matt Ebnet, Scott Martelle,=20 Dennis McLellan, Monte Morin, Jason Song, Mai Tran and Nancy Wride in Orang= e=20 County, and Richard Simon in Washington contributed to this story. --- --- Fragile Supply Network Apt to Fail=20 By JENIFER WARREN and ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writers=20 ?????A lot of people were caught off guard by the blackouts that swept over= =20 California this week. Debra Bowen wasn't one of them. ?????As chairwoman of the state Senate Energy Committee, she is=20 intimately--and painfully--familiar with the state's energy supply.

In fact, they haven't. ?????More than anything, this week's events illustrate the delicate balance= =20 of factors that keep California illuminated, from the multitude of supply= =20 sources to the weather. ?????Temperatures were higher than usual.

To help officials predict available supply,=20 generators provide an annual maintenance plan that is updated regularly. ?????In addition, however, facilities sometimes shut down for unexpected=20 reasons: leaking tubes, burnt-out transformers, cracked turbines and faulty= =20 feed pumps. At one point Tuesday, about 8,200 megawatts were unavailable=20 because of unscheduled shutdowns. That's enough to supply about 6 million= =20 households, and up from 5,700 megawatts a week ago. ?????The huge 1,400-megawatt Mohave power plant near Laughlin, Nev., which= =20 supplies Southern California Edison and the Los Angeles Department of Water= =20 and Power, was felled Monday by a transformer problem. That was enough to= =20 push the state into blackouts. ?????A growing number of skeptics, however, question whether those reasons= =20 are always valid, accusing generators of withholding power to shrink supply= =20 and drive up prices. ?????\"There's no way to verify it, so you've got to take their word for it,= \"=20 said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who studies California's= =20 electricity market. \"And given that it's very profitable for these things t= o=20 occur, you start to wonder if they're creating an artificial scarcity.\" ?????Tom Williams of Duke Energy said the Houston-based company is working= =20 hard to keep its California power plants, which are capable of producing=20 3,351 megawatts of electricity, in operation after months of near-continuou= s=20 operation. ?????\"It's like riding a moped across the country,\" he said. \"They're just= =20 not meant to run this hard.\" ?????Last week, the state Senate formed a committee to investigate charges = of=20 market manipulation by power suppliers.

Gray Davis said negotiations to buy the power grid owned= =20 by the state's largest utilities \"are proceeding at an accelerated pace.\" ?????Wall Street consultant Joseph Fichera said talks with Southern=20 California Edison could be wrapped up within days, although those with PG&E= =20 are much less advanced.=20 ?????The administration and PG&E have not reached even an agreement in=20 principle, he said. PG&E, which has more debt than Edison, says its=20 transmission lines are more extensive than those of its Southern California= =20 counterpart. ?????The state wants to buy the utilities' transmission lines and other=20 assets for about $7 billion to provide cash to the utilities, help stabiliz= e=20 the electricity supply and ease the power crunch that has plagued Californi= a=20 for months. To research the grid purchase, Fichera said, the state has had = to=20 pore over 80,000 documents just to assess the utilities' liabilities. ?????\"We are working at a good pace,\" said Fichera, chief executive of the= =20 New York firm Saber Partners. \" . . . If we get to a deal-breaker, it might= =20 be longer.\" ?????By making Fichera, who is also a consultant to the Texas Public=20 Utilities Commission, available to reporters Tuesday, the Davis=20 administration was clearly trying to reassure the public that progress is= =20 being made on the governor's plan to pull the state out of the crisis. ?????Since mid-January, when the big utilities' credit failed and suppliers= =20 stopped selling to them, the state has spent nearly $3 billion buying=20 electricity from a handful of large suppliers in Texas, Oklahoma, Georgia a= nd=20 North Carolina. Not a cent has gone to the hundreds of alternative energy= =20 suppliers in California who provide about a quarter of the state's=20 electricity. ?????The Monday and Tuesday blackouts occurred partly because many of the= =20 cash-strapped alternative suppliers, including solar, biomass and wind powe= r=20 units, cut their normal supply to the system in half. They say Edison and= =20 PG&E have not paid them since November; the utilities say they are out of= =20 cash. ?????Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek) said the plight of the=20 alternative suppliers has dragged on because of the complexity of dealing= =20 with \"almost 700 individual contractors.\" ?????Another delaying factor, said Keeley, who with state Sen. Jim Battin= =20 (R-La Quinta) worked for almost three months to come up with a legislative= =20 plan to lower the small producers' prices, was \"the huge enmity . . .=20 manifested between the utilities and the qualifying facilities. These peopl= e=20 just don't like each other.\" ?????This week's blackouts provided two painful lessons for the Davis=20 administration: ?????* When it comes to electricity, size doesn't matter--every kilowatt=20 counts. During peak use, a small wind power facility in Riverside County ca= n=20 make the difference between full power and blackouts. ?????* There is no such thing as a partial solution. Unless the whole energ= y=20 equation is balanced, the parts don't work. ?????For the Davis plan to work, several key elements need to come together= =20 or utility customers will almost certainly face rate increases above the 19= %=20 already set in motion: ?????* The cost of power purchased by the state must be reduced through=20 long-term contracts with the big out-of-state producers. ?????These contracts, the details of which the Davis administration has kep= t=20 confidential, are still being negotiated by Davis consultant Vikram Budhraj= a=20 of the Pasadena firm Electric Power Group. The administration says it has= =20 concluded 40 contracts with generators, about half of which have been signe= d. ?????According to the most recent statistics released by the Department of= =20 Water Resources, which buys power for the state, current prices are still= =20 well above the rate state Treasurer Phil Angelides says is necessary for a= =20 planned $10-billion bond offering to succeed. ?????The bonds, set for sale in May, will be used to reimburse the state fo= r=20 the money it will have spent by that time to buy electricity. The state is= =20 currently spending at a rate of $58 million a day to buy power.

Critic= s=20 renew call for full disclosure.=20 By DAN MORAIN , Times Staff Writer=20 ?????SACRAMENTO--As part of his closed-door negotiations to buy electricity= ,=20 Gov. Gray Davis has agreed to relieve some generators from having to pay=20 potentially millions of dollars in fees for emitting pollutants into the ai= r,=20 Davis said Tuesday. ?????Davis announced two weeks ago that his negotiators had reached deals= =20 with 20 generators to supply $43 billion worth of power during the next 10= =20 years. ?????However, the Democratic governor has refused to release any of the=20 contracts or detail various terms, contending that release of such=20 information would hamper the state's ability to negotiate deals with other= =20 generators and therefore ultimately would raise prices Californians pay for= =20 electricity. ?????Sources familiar with the negotiations, speaking on condition of=20 anonymity, said the agreement reached with Dynegy Inc., a power company bas= ed=20 in Houston, is one that includes language requiring that the state pay the= =20 cost of credits that allow emissions. Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel declin= ed=20 to discuss the company's deal with the state. ?????\"We couldn't get them to sign contracts; it was a sticking point,\" Dav= is=20 said of the decision to pay the fees of some generators. \"We had to lock do= wn=20 some power so we were not totally dependent on the spot market.\" ?????The fees in question are part of an emission trading system known as= =20 RECLAIM. Under the system, companies are allotted a certain amount of=20 allowable pollution. If their operations pollute more, companies are requir= ed=20 to purchase credits on an open market. Currently the credits cost about $45= =20 per pound of pollution--an amount that can lead to a bill of well over $10= =20 million a year for a power plant. ?????The South Coast Air Quality Management District, which regulates=20 pollution in the Los Angeles Basin, is considering steps to significantly= =20 lower the cost of the system--a step that could considerably cut the state'= s=20 potential cost, Davis said. ?????Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey)=20 defended the decision to cover the power company's costs. ?????\"It is a question of whether it brings down the price of power,\" she= =20 said. \"If it brings down the price of power, I don't have a problem with it= .\" ?????Nevertheless, word that the contracts could bind the state to pay=20 pollution fees caused some critics of Davis' policy to renew calls for Davi= s=20 to reconsider the secrecy surrounding the power negotiations. The payment= =20 provision underscores the fact that the contracts involve more than merely= =20 the prices the state will pay for its megawatts, the critics note. ?????\"The Legislature should have known about it,\" said Senate President Pr= o=20 Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco). \"It is going to cost taxpayers money. It= =20 makes you wonder. . . . This was a policy issue that was never discussed wi= th=20 the Legislature.\" ?????V. John White, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club, who also represents=20 alternative energy producers, called the contract proposal \"a horrible=20 precedent.\" ?????\"Until we know exactly what the state has agreed to and how much of a= =20 subsidy this represents, we can't determine how serious the breach of=20 principle this is,\" White said. ?????Another critic of the secrecy of the negotiations, Terry Francke,=20 general counsel for the California First Amendment Coalition, said the=20 provision in question \"raises the possibility that there are other=20 [concessions]\" that have not yet come to light. ?????In the summer, when demand for power is highest, some generators=20 probably will exceed pollution limits set by regional air quality managemen= t=20 districts. ?????To avert blackouts, state officials might ask the companies to keep=20 plants running. In such cases, some sources familiar with aspects of the=20 contracts said, the contract language could be interpreted to suggest that= =20 the state would cover any fines--although Davis said Tuesday the state will= =20 not cover the cost of fines. ?????A recent Dynegy filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission=20 underscores the rising cost of pollution-related measures. The company, whi= ch=20 is partners with NRG Energy in three California plants in El Segundo, Long= =20 Beach and Carlsbad in San Diego County, said its \"aggregate expenditures fo= r=20 compliance with laws related to the regulation of discharge of materials in= to=20 the environment\" rose to $14.3 million in 2000, from $3.6 million in 1999. ?????A South Coast Air Quality Management spokesman said Dynegy's facilitie= s=20 appear to be fairly clean--although Sierra Club lobbyist White said Dynegy= =20 has been seeking a permit at one of its plants to burn fuel oil, which is= =20 dirtier than natural gas. ?????Davis said he intends to \"make this information public,\" but he added= =20 that \"we do not want to put the public's interest in jeopardy by asking the= m=20 to pay higher prices.\" ?????\"Nobody likes the notion that [the administration is] not being fully= =20 forthcoming,\" Davis said. \"But I also have a corollary responsibility that = I=20 don't stick these generators with a higher rate.\" --- As Losses Mount, Companies Work Around Outages=20 By MARLA DICKERSON,JERRY HIRSCH and NANCY CLEELAND, Times Staff Writers=20 ?????As blackouts moved from theory to reality, many Southern California=20 businesses spent Day 2 assessing their losses and digging in for what they= =20 expect to be a long, hot summer. ?????An hour without electricity may be an inconvenience for most residents= .=20 But for manufacturers and many other businesses, even a brief loss of power= =20 can generate tens of thousands in losses. ?????Whether shaping metal or making salsa, businesses of all kinds=20 complained Tuesday about the lack of warning of impending outages, even as= =20 they sought sometimes creative ways to work around the loss of power. ?????Rattled by news reports of Monday's rolling blackouts, Industry-based = El=20 Burrito Mexican Food Products started its Tuesday shift at 2 a.m. Workers h= ad=20 just finished cooking and packaging the last batches of salsa and masa when= =20 the lights went out at 10:20 a.m. ?????\"We dodged a bullet,\" said El Burrito founder Mark Roth. \"Losing a day= 's=20 production of salsa would have cost me $15,000 to $20,000.\" ?????But other companies weren't so fortunate. ?????Long Beach-based Delco Machine & Gear was still totaling up its losses= =20 from Monday's blackout, which amounted to at least $30,000 in lost wages an= d=20 production, said Nick Campanelli, vice president of manufacturing. The=20 company, a division of Florida-based B/E Aerospace Inc., makes parts for th= e=20 aerospace industry. The sudden loss of power caused its sophisticated metal= =20 cutting and grinding machines to crash, ruining precision parts in producti= on. ?????But the losses don't end there.

Campanelli is particularly irked that the=20 company received no warning. ?????\"Five minutes' notice,\" he fumed. \"That's all I needed.\" ?????Although businesses such as Campanelli's typically receive no warning= =20 that they are about to lose power, insurance companies count the rolling=20 blackouts as \"planned events,\" a determination that in most cases=20 disqualifies a business from making a claim. ?????\"I know it must be frustrating for businesses who have the power go of= f=20 suddenly, but these outages are planned by the grid operators,\" said Pete= =20 Moraga of the Insurance Information Network of California. \"That means it= =20 would not be a covered peril in a traditional business insurance policy.\" ?????Typically, business insurance covers loss of profit and damage from=20 unforeseen events such as fires or windstorms.

Backup power will kick on emergency lights and allow th= e=20 cash registers to complete transactions. Employees are instructed to escort= =20 customers from the building safely, Levra said. ?????Other businesses, however, have plans to remain open during the 60- to= =20 90-minute blackouts. ?????When power went out at two Cheesecake Factory restaurants in Orange=20 County on Monday afternoon, the eateries switched to serving cold dishes su= ch=20 as sandwiches and salads, said Howard Gordon, senior vice president of the= =20 Calabasas Hills-based chain. ?????The restaurants had enough backup power to operate emergency lights an= d=20 cash registers.

Delivering the keynote address at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's national= =20 energy summit in Washington Monday, Abraham said, \"California is not the on= ly=20 state facing a mismatch between supply and demand,\" what with \"electricity= =20 shortages predicted for New York City and Long Island this summer\" and low= =20 capacity margins threatening electricity reliability elsewhere across the= =20 country. But how likely is it that New Yorkers will face blackouts of the= =20 sort confronting Californians?=20 Not very, says energy trade specialist Edward Krapels, managing director of= =20 Boston-based METIS Trading Advisors. Krapels, a consultant helping major=20 Northeastern utilities, such as Consolidated Edison, design market-hedging= =20 programs, adamantly decried what he said are facile comparisons between=20 conditions in New York and California, there being \"more differences than= =20 there are similarities\" between those two industrial cornerstones of the=20 country's economy in respect to energy security management.=20 \"First of all, New York has a more varied portfolio of energy generation=20 sources than California,\" he said. California has hydro, nuclear and gas, b= ut=20 when it lost a lot of hydro, the state needed gas to pick up the slack, and= =20 the \"capacity just wasn't there.\" In New York's case, the state has oil and= =20 coal still in the mix and its overall dependence on gas is much lower than= =20 California's, Krapels added.=20 New York avoids making same mistakes Portfolio diversity is one pillar of any effective plan to help New York=20 avoid the same errors made in redesigning California's marketplace. New=20 York's Independent System Operator (ISO), in a new report warning that the= =20 state is at an \"energy crossroads\" in terms of its capacity adequacy in the= =20 immediate future, argues that a concerted effort is required to arrest=20 declining in-state generation capacity reserve margins, and a strategy must= =20 be put in place, whether or not new generation comes on-line, in accordance= =20 with current anticipated scenarios.=20 A measure of New York's essential difficulty is that, between 1995 and 2000= ,=20 statewide demand for electricity grew 2,700 MW, while generating capacity= =20 expanded by only 1,060 MW. With no major new generating plants in downstate= =20 New York fully approved, the gap is expected to continue to widen. To avoid= =20 \"a replication of California's market meltdown\" the New York ISO calculates= =20 the state's daily generating capacity needs to grow by 8,600 MW by 2005, wi= th=20 more than half of that located in New York City and on Long Island.=20 Expressing concern this may be too big a burden for the current bureaucrati= c=20 process to bear, the ISO wants to see a state-appointed ombudsman named to= =20 help would-be merchant power plant investors plow through red tape.=20 \"Increasing New York's generating capacity will also lessen the state's=20 escalating and risky reliance on out-of-state sources of electricity,\" the= =20 ISO added. \"Since 1999, New York State has been unable to cover its reserve= =20 requirements from in-state sources.\"=20 Not everyone agrees with that analysis, insofar as it argues for circling t= he=20 wagons inward. Some analysts believe the ultimate solution lies not in tyin= g=20 in more inwardly dedicated power, but in expanding the marketplace by=20 breaking down inter-jurisdictional barriers. In any case, New York energy= =20 regulatory authorities and those responsible elsewhere in the U.S. Northeas= t,=20 such as PJM (Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland) Interconnection and the New= =20 England Power Pool, are in vastly better shape in terms of \"cross-border\"= =20 cooperation than California and its neighbors in that efforts are being mad= e=20 among various authorities toward developing an integrated regional=20 electricity market.

SB 28x (Sher/Battin) makes various changes to the siting process including many IEP-sponsored proposals. As you will recall, two new provisions were added to the bill at the last minute before going to the Assembly Floor dealing with both retrofit schedules and environmental dispatch of generating facilities. Per the direction from IEP member companies, IEP has decided not to negotiate on the environmental dispatch issue. If the provision remained in the bill, IEP would continue to push the Republicans to hold their opposed position. We were, however, given the authority to negotiate on the retrofit issue as long as we were only talking about facilities that already have retrofit requirements. I will be faxing out the agreed upon language which in essence says the ARB shall set a schedule for the completion of any mandated retrofits. It does not expand the authority of the air districts and ARB to mandate retrofits under existing law. The schedule would require completion of the retrofits by July 1, 2004 or such later date as the ISO determines is necessary to maintain reliability. With these amendments, including some clean-up language, SB 28x will be voted-on on the Assembly floor on Monday and go to the Senate for concurrence on Tuesday. The final version will include the following IEP-sponsored proposals: ? Conforming the timing of offsets for power plants to Clean Air Act requirements ? Substituting CEQA-style hearings for the trial-like proceedings of the CE= C ? Streamlining the permit process for the modernization of existing power plant sites ? Giving consideration to the positive environmental impacts of a proposed project. ? Improving the timeliness and coordination of state and local agency review. ? Extending the current deadlines for the expedited review process established in AB 970. Since SB 28x is only a first step in making changes to the siting process, IEP member should now be thinking about what is next. IEP proposals still on the table include: ? Permitting local agencies to make zoning changes or other decisions for power plants contingent upon CEC CEQA Compliance ? Giving deference to other state and regional agencies ? Easing the threshold for override of local land use requirements. ? Making the ISO responsible for determining interconnection requirements -- Bad news on the =01&California First=018 issue quickly followed the good= news. The CEC staff analysis which said the State can't require builders of new power plants to sell electricity here, even as a trade-off for expedited permitting, was countered by another staff analysis that says the state can= . Both documents cannot be obtained due to attorney-client privilege. This issue is coming to a head next week with a decision pending by the CEC to include a California First clause on the approval of an expedited AES power plant project. AB 60x (Hertzberg), which ties to the siting process the requirement that a developer enter into a contract to sell power to specified California entities, is still poised to be heard in the Senate Energy committee. IEP members company lobbyist should continue to lobby against this measure regardless of the CEC=01,s decision on AES, although our arguments are definitely strengthened if the addition of the clause at the CEC is denied. -- IEP has finalized negotiations with Senator Burton=01,s office on amendm= ents attempting to solve our problem with the eminent domain provision in SB 6x (Burton), which is the State Power Authority measure. Attached is a copy o= f the bill in PDF form. The agreed upon language, which clarifies that the Authority=01,s purpose is to supplement existing generation activities, can= be found on pages 6-7 (Section 3310), 13 (Section 3341.1) and 16-17 (Section3352). Considering the inflammatory remarks made by Senator Burton in the press lately regarding seizing generation assets, this was most likely the best we could get. -- The first of Senator Dunn=01,s hearings with the Senate Select Committee= to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Market occurred this week. This week and next week=01,s topics will be to go over previous investigati= ons into market power. The committee heard or will be hearing testimony from: Frank Wolak, Chairman Market Surveillance Committee, CAISO; Eric Hildebrandt, Manager Market Monitoring, CAISO; and, Elaine Howle, State Auditor. -- The Assembly Electricity Oversight Subcommittee met this week and focused on the issue of natural gas collusion. Testifying before the committee were representatives from Dynegy and El Paso, commenting on the rise of natural gas prices and whether illegal market manipulation and collusion occurred. The subcommittee plans on putting together a package o= f bills related to natural gas issues, which would be the culmination of the committee=01,s hearings over the last two months. This package will be up = for consideration first by the whole special Assembly Energy committee. -- Governor Davis came out this week supporting the construction of the Calpine Metcalf Energy Center, the 600-megawatt power plant proposed for th= e San Jose region. The Governor urged the CEC to approve the plant siting so that construction can begin. -- Two long-term contracting bills are scheduled for hearings next week. IEP counsel is currently reviewing AB 57 (Wright) and SB 997 (Morrow) and will comment on their provisions as soon as possible. -- Attached is the most recent legislative tracking reports, both the special session and regular session.

{"id": 157, "content": "While I appreciate the virtue of flying below the radar if possible, the matter here is complicated by the fact that FERC's discovery rules (18 CFR, Subpart D) pertain only to \"proceedings set for hearing . . . and to such proceedings as the Commission may order.\" 18 CFR 385.401. In this case, FERC stated that \"a trial-type hearing is not necessary . . . .\" and specifically rejected the use of a \"trial-type evidentiary hearing.\" Slip op. at 47-48 & n.97. Thus, while I have not researched the matter as yet, my preliminary view is that the CPUC's attempt to invoke FERC's discovery processes would appear to be outside the contemplation of FERC's Nov. 1 order and its regulations, unless FERC specifically orders discovery in this case. (The CPUC seems to recognize the relevance of this consideration when it specifically attempts to equate \"paper\" hearings with \"trial-type\" hearings; see page 1 of its Motion.) The CPUC's motion may prompt FERC to decide whether or not to allow discovery in this case under Rule 401. While the CPUC's motion does not apply directly to marketers, FERC's ruling will be precedent in the event the CPUC or someone else hereafter serves discovery on other parties. As a result, we need to consider whether laying in the weeds risks losing an opportunity to present our views on whether FERC should allow discovery in a paper hearing with an expedited decisional track, particularly in light of the fact that Staff has already conducted. >>> Jeffrey Watkiss 11/08/00 10:31AM >>> Does anyone have an idea as to why marketers, including EPMI, are not included in the list of subject companies: Exh. B? Since EPMI is not a subject of the motion, why should it answer? Lying in the weeds may be a more prudent course of action. >>> \"Fergus, Gary S.\" <GFergus@brobeck.com> 11/07/00 10:08PM >>> I just spoke with Mary to make sure we have the same information. Here are the facts we have so far. On November 4th, the CPUC filed a motion with FERC to adopt the form of protective order that the CPUC entered, to compel the production of documents and to shorten time to answer. According to Exhibit B (read to me by Nancy Pickover at Bracewell) the following CPUC moved against the following entities: AES, Williams, Duke, Dynegy, Reliant and Southern. Enron entities were NOT named in exhibit B. This is not to say that we could not be easily added to the group. While the motion reads as if the CPUC was moving against everybody, in fact, in footnote 2 they state they are only moving against the entities named in Exhibit B. We will have Exhibit B in hand first thing tomorrow via FEDEX to confirm this. To repeat, Enron is not named yet.

Given the timing, we should discuss this on our conference call scheduled for tomorrow. They request that we be required: to answer their motion on Thursday, to provide the information within 5 working days of a FERC ordering production, and to provide of P&L information and spread sheets detailing our deals, specifically delivery point, delivery date, counterparty, volume and price. We may not have a problem providing this information for use by FERC in its proceeding subject to a confidentiality agreement but I think we would oppose their requests for: the information to be provided for \"government eyes only\" - this would prohibit EPMI from defending itself vis-a-vis other market participants. a FERC confidentiality order that would could allow FERC to \"share\" this information with the CPUC (for purposes of the PUC's OII proceeding) pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 824h(c). 16 USC 824g(c) requires the Commission to make information available to state commissions as may be of assistance in state regulation of public utilities. We should argue that 16 USC 824h(c) does not apply here given that we are not a public utility nor does the PUC regulate how much market power wholesale marketers exercise or the level of market power mitigation (these are the bases the PUC provides for explaining why it should have this information.) the above contractual information to allow them to analyze the competitiveness of the forward market to evaluate the wisdom of the Commission's decision to allow the UDC's \"unfettered access\" to the forwards market. This argument is unpersuasive given that the CPUC can get information about the competitiveness of the forward markets from the Wall Street Journal's listing of NYMEX prices.

Although until that moment I hadn't thought of returning to Washington except to serve again in national office, I would be pleased to talk further about this opportunity with you or your recruiter. In recalling our conversation, I realize that twice you asked if I had any questions, and if I had been quick to take advantage of your offer, I would have asked how government relations are handled at Enron. To whom does Joe Hillings report: to you or to Terry Thorne? You mentioned a woman who currently has responsibility for government relations in Texas and some neighboring states but is leaving for another job at Enron; to whom does she report? Then there is Joe Allen, whom I have known since our days in the Legislature; doesn't he (also) handle Texas affairs? I am sorry I didn't ask you all this on Tuesday. Whatever the answers, it's clear that government relations are much more central to the work of Enron than at Compaq, which is why it would be a very exciting place to work.

The agency recently authorized= =20 funding for three co-firing demonstration projects.=20 In Iowa, the Chariton Valley Biomass Project is a cooperative effort to=20 develop warm and cool season grasses (such as switchgrass) to co-fire with= =20 coal at Alliant Energy's Ottumwa Generating Station.

Gray Davis= =20 into a dramatically different exit strategy for the energy crisis: writing= =20 off the $5 billion the state has already spent on electricity and borrowing= =20 billions less to finance future power purchases. ?????GOP lawmakers are holding up emergency legislation needed to replenish= =20 the budget for power costs, because they don't think the Democratic=20 governor's plan to get California out of the power business will work. They= =20 say the plan is full of dangerously optimistic assumptions, such as estimat= es=20 that 90% of the state's alternative energy producers will be generating=20 electricity this summer--only two-thirds are now--and that Californians wil= l=20 use 7% less electricity. ?????Although Republicans don't control either house, the emergency=20 legislation requires a two-thirds vote, which gives the GOP significant swa= y. ?????The plan from the Republican leadership would commit taxpayer money fo= r=20 the first time to an electricity problem that has only affected customers o= f=20 private utilities. Because the plan is sure to draw strong opposition from= =20 politicians in Los Angeles and other areas served by public power agencies,= =20 Republicans have included a complex, $1.5-billion proposal to provide refun= ds=20 to those served by municipal utilities. ?????By blocking the emergency legislation, Republicans may stop state=20 Treasurer Phil Angelides from securing a $4.13-billion loan to repay state= =20 coffers for electricity purchases--a failure that would reduce the money=20 available to Davis for his next budget and possibly delay his plan to resol= ve=20 the energy crisis. Angelides needs the bill to guarantee repayment for the= =20 loan. ?????If Angelides does not obtain legislative approval by Monday, he will= =20 miss a Tuesday deadline lenders had given him to close the loan. That would= =20 clearly leave Davis with less money for new education, police and=20 road-building programs as he begins planning his next budget this month. ?????Moreover, failure to pass the bill could delay a record bond issue tha= t=20 Davis promised would replenish the budget and shield it from further energy= =20 drains by summer. And it could harm sagging confidence on Wall Street that= =20 California can deliver on its plans to manage the energy crisis, Angelides= =20 said. ?????California's credit rating has already been downgraded by one credit= =20 agency, Standard & Poor's, largely because of concerns about the effect of= =20 electricity purchases on state finances. ?????Negotiations Are Continuing ?????\"The Republicans appear to be digging in and playing a dangerous game = of=20 financial roulette with the state. This is really ludicrous to me,\" Angelid= es=20 said. \"Standard & Poor's has already downgraded us. The other credit rating= =20 agencies are watching. I just don't understand what the Republicans are=20 thinking.\" ?????Said Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox (R-Fair Oaks): \"We're not=20 prepared to give the governor a blank check.\" ?????Democrats threatened Thursday to test the Republicans' resolve by=20 bringing the bill to a vote in the Assembly, but backed down. Negotiations= =20 among legislative leaders continue. ?????To avoid widespread blackouts, the state government entered the=20 electricity-buying business in January after the private utilities became t= oo=20 burdened with debt to continue purchasing power on the expensive wholesale= =20 market. ?????Under a plan approved by the Legislature and signed into law by Davis,= =20 the state budget is to be repaid for the power purchases through a massive= =20 municipal bond issue, expected to be the largest in American history. The= =20 bonds, in turn, are to be paid off by utility ratepayers through a slice of= =20 their monthly bills. ?????However, the plan was based on the premise that the state would quickl= y=20 bring down power costs by entering into long-term contracts with suppliers-= -a=20 scenario that has yet to materialize. ?????In fact, California's power costs have gone up since January. Lawmaker= s=20 initially estimated that $10 billion in bonds would allow the budget to be= =20 repaid and cover future power purchases. Davis is now proposing $12.5 billi= on=20 in bonds--and higher electric bills--to finance the state's costs until 200= 3. ?????Republicans are convinced that it will not be enough. They say the=20 Angelides bridge loan is not needed because the state has money in various= =20 funds that could cover power purchases well into the fall. ?????They also confess to political considerations. Republican legislators= =20 believe that by allowing Angelides to obtain his loan now, they will be=20 powerless to oppose further borrowing later. The loan Angelides set up with= =20 J.P. Morgan Chase and several other financial services companies is to be= =20 repaid with the bond issue. If the loan is not repaid by the end of the=20 summer, the interest rate will rise dramatically, a situation that would ma= ke=20 it hard for the minority Republicans to oppose more bonds. ?????The strong GOP views were shaped in part by Democratic state Controlle= r=20 Kathleen Connell, who met with Republican legislators earlier this week and= =20 shared a highly critical appraisal of Davis' plan. ?????Connell told the Republicans that the governor's strategy was based on= a=20 series of assumptions about electricity market conditions in California thi= s=20 summer that, in her view, are highly improbable. ?????\"It is almost impossible for all these hypothetical situations=20 envisioned in their scenario to occur at once,\" Connell said. ?????But even if all the assumptions came to pass, she predicted that=20 California would still need to secure another source of financing by next= =20 spring to continue energy purchases. Davis administration officials have=20 rebutted her claim. ?????\"I am deeply troubled by this incremental approach to this financing= =20 that is long-term in nature and is going to burden the state for many years= ,\"=20 Connell said, in what appeared to be a reference to Davis' reputation as a= =20 plodder.=20 ?????Using Surplus to Pay for Electricity ?????Republicans, who have traditionally been opposed to financing public= =20 programs with large bond issues, contend that Davis needs to reevaluate his= =20 plan. By proposing to essentially forget the $5 billion the state has spent= =20 so far on power, they are advocating using up the state's projected budget= =20 surplus on electricity costs, even if it means cutting new government=20 programs. ?????\"If Gov. Davis continues down this path, he could bankrupt the state,\"= =20 said Assemblyman Dennis Mountjoy (R-Monrovia). \"That would have a far great= er=20 impact on education.\" ?????Democrats, who strongly believe that the surplus should be invested in= =20 roads, schools and to meet other long-term future needs, are unlikely to ev= er=20 support the idea. Lawmakers are already discussing outflanking the=20 Republicans by drafting a bill to repay the budget on a nonemergency basis,= =20 which would only require a majority vote. ?????That, however, would probably delay the financing until at least Augus= t,=20 since nonemergency measures do not take effect for 90 days--giving Californ= ia=20 only about six weeks to cut the largest municipal bond deal ever before sta= te=20 coffers begin to empty, according to Angelides. ?????There is another potential consequence: Many of the long-term contract= s=20 the Davis administration has reached to purchase electricity contain clause= s=20 that may make them void if the state does not obtain financing by July. ?????\"This is a very dangerous game,\" Angelides said. ?????In other electricity developments Thursday: ?????* Over Republican objections, Democrats in the state Senate approved a= nd=20 sent to Davis a far-reaching bill that would put state government in the=20 business of operating its own power plants and selling electricity at cheap= er=20 rates than private companies. The bill, SB 6x by Senate leader John Burton= =20 (D-San Francisco), would create a state power authority with the ability to= =20 finance, buy, own and build generation plants and sell the energy at=20 cost-based rates. ?????on likened the proposed government body to the New York Power Authorit= y,=20 approved by GOP Gov. George Pataki, which brought about a 10% reduction in= =20 rates. ?????The difference from the current situation is that \"the people of=20 California, the ratepayers, would benefit, and not the corporate officers a= nd=20 not the shareholders\" of private energy companies, Burton said. ?????But Republicans attacked the power authority as \"more government\" that= =20 would impose itself on an enterprise better suited for private operators wi= th=20 years of expertise. ?????\"This is a horrific mistake and one that California ratepayers will be= =20 paying for many years to come,\" said state Sen.

The company said it recently received a $1-billion bi= ll=20 for such purchases in January and February. ?????\"By purchasing wholesale power at a cost higher than the retail rates= =20 and sending us the bill, [Cal-ISO] . . . could be reducing the value of our= =20 assets by hundreds of millions of dollars a month,\" said PG&E spokesman Ron= =20 Low. ?????In its motion, the company argued that Cal-ISO is violating bankruptcy= =20 law by requiring the utility to pay more for power than it can collect from= =20 state-regulated rates frozen under California's deregulation plan. PG&E sai= d=20 Cal-ISO's actions would force the utility to seek credit on onerous terms. ?????The motion also contended Cal-ISO is violating an April 6 order by the= =20 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that said the grid operator could only= =20 buy power on behalf of credit-worthy entities. ?????That same day, PG&E sought Chapter 11 protection from creditors, sayin= g=20 it was $9 billion in debt.

PG&amp;E had asked the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles to overrule PUC decisions that the utility was not entitled to the money, which the utility spent buying electricity on the increasingly expensive wholesale market. In dismissing the lawsuit Wednesday, Judge Ronald S.W. Lew said ``PG&amp;E's claims are not yet ripe for review,'' meaning the case wasn't ready for trial. Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, declared the decision a win for California ratepayers. ``PG&amp;E was banking on winning this case and using it as one of their excuses for not negotiating with the governor. It appears at least for now they failed,'' Maviglio said. But because the case was dismissed on procedural grounds rather than merit, PG&amp;E said the door was left open for the utility to refile its action once the commission makes final its interim orders on PG&amp;E's requested rate increase. ``The court determined that our lawsuit was premature because the CPUC had not yet finalized its various decisions on PG&amp;E's request for recovery of its costs to purchase wholesale power,'' PG&amp;E said in a statement. ``Today's action allows us to continue to pursue the merits of the case on a timely basis.'' A similar federal case filed by Southern California Edison is on hold, said company spokeswoman Clara Potes-Fellow. Edison, the state's second-largest utility, would drop that case as part of a rescue plan negotiated by Davis, which also includes the state buying the utility's transmission lines for $2.7 billion. Since last June, the two utilities say they have lost more than $14 billion. California's 1996 deregulation law froze electricity prices for customers of the state's three investor-owned utilities. When prices rose to record levels over the past year, PG&amp;E was unable to recoup the higher costs from its customers' bills. The undercollection, along with a failed deal to sell its transmission lines to the state, drove PG&amp;E to file for federal Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 6, the company argued. On Wednesday, the parent company, PG&amp;E Corp., reported a first-quarter loss of $951 million, or $2.62 per share. The first-quarter loss follows a fourth-quarter loss of $4.1 billion that also stemmed from continuing costs in California's power crisis. Bankruptcy Update/ PG&E Files Motion to Require CAISO to Follow Federal Law SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 3, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation - Pacific Gas and Electric Company has filed a motion in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court asking the court to direct the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) to comply with bankruptcy law, its Tariff, and a recent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) ruling, and stop billing the utility for wholesale power purchased. Pacific Gas and Electric Company's motion, which includes a request for a preliminary injunction, asks the court to enjoin the CAISO from requiring the utility to pay costs the CAISO has incurred and continues to incur to purchase wholesale power on its behalf, unless the utility can fully recover these costs. Bankruptcy law imposes an automatic stay to prevent parties from making certain claims or taking certain actions that would interfere with the estate or property of the estate of a Chapter 11 debtor. By purchasing power at costs higher than existing retail prices, and then sending the bill to the utility, the CAISO is violating the automatic stay provision and could be reducing the value of the company's assets by potentially hundreds of millions of dollars per month, depending on the average retail rate, the wholesale price, and the amount of power purchased by the CAISO. Recently, the CAISO sent Pacific Gas and Electric Company a bill for January and February spot market purchases that totaled nearly $1 billion. The action alleges that requiring the utility to pay more than it can collect in its existing generation-related rates would be improper under federal Bankruptcy Code because it is not in the best interest of the estate, would be an unauthorized post-petition use of Pacific Gas and Electric Company's property, and would force the utility to undertake credit on onerous terms. In addition, on April 6, 2001, FERC ordered the CAISO to comply with its February 14 order, in which FERC ordered that the CAISO could only buy power on behalf of creditworthy entities. Both Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Southern California Edison Company are no longer creditworthy companies. By continuing to purchase power on behalf of Pacific Gas and Electric Company, the CAISO is in violation of its own Tariff, FERC orders, and federal law.

But he also said there is a right way and a wrong way to do it. Enron and others had provided a market based answer by offering a fixed price deal to SDG&E (which would have enabled them to cap rates to those who had not switched. California elected instead to cap rates and deficit spend (ie create a deferral account).

Is trading an insider's game?=20 Buying, selling of electricity is a growth business, but some say deck is= =20 stacked against consumers By Craig D.

Consider the case of power generated by AES=20 Corp.'s California plants.=20 In 1998, AES made a bold move.

But trading companies closely guar= d=20 their positions.=20 This much can be said with certainty: Electricity that AES sold for less th= an=20 5 cents per kilowatt-hour to Williams changed hands perhaps 10 times in the= =20 wholesale market and emerged at times in recent months with a price tag for= =20 consumers that was 300 percent higher.=20 Williams' trading profits increased by 523 percent in the first quarter thi= s=20 year. Advance sales All this buying and selling creates curious confluences.=20 In their attempt to deflect criticism over high prices, generating companie= s=20 such as Duke Energy -- operator of the South Bay Power Plant in Chula and= =20 others in the state -- frequently note that they sell most of their=20 electricity far in advance. But they acknowledge less often that their=20 trading units may also be buying power, which could boost the company's=20 electricity inventory.=20 Duke was the fourth biggest electricity trader last year and cited its=20 trading activity as a prime contributor to its wholesale business profits,= =20 which soared 324 percent in the first quarter to $348 million.=20 It is a company's power traders who frequently direct plant operators to=20 increase or decrease the generation of power in response to market=20 conditions.=20 Energy companies have little option but to turn to trading for profits. One= =20 of the better kept secrets of electrical deregulation and its promise of=20 competition is that there is remarkably little competition in the productio= n=20 side of the business.=20 For one thing, electricity is a commodity; power from one company is=20 indistinguishable from that generated by others.=20 More important, nearly all modern plants generate power from turbines built= =20 by a handful of manufacturers.

I only suggest this so we can stay out of the limelight by not being one of the \"bad guy\" generators who are actively taking on the protective order, when we know that at least four generators are producing nothing until their motion is resolved, and one marketer (Coral/Shell Energy) has refused to produce transactional data and has objected to most of the document request. I have also recently learned that Calpine has gotten an extension until Oct. 13 and will try to delay and hold off producing much data.

These generators are taking a much harder line. Counsel for Southern has advised me that some of the generators may challenge a large part of the data request on grounds of jurisdictional, burden, and trade secret intrusion. It seems to me that it may be best to let the generators fight for a stronger protective order, and not take their side at this time. We might well want to consider proposing a \"most favored nations clause\" in our letter to the CPUC tomorrow in order to take advantage of what ever tighter protective order is eventually agreed to. Generally, I feel the generators' stance will allow us to be right where we want to be, not out front leading the charge, not turning over everything right away, but instead making \"just enough\" of a production to avoid being the center of attention. I will forward the generators' pleadings to you as attachments to this e-mail. Gary, I believe, already has them.

{"id": 155, "content": "I just spoke with Mary to make sure we have the same information. Here are the facts we have so far. On November 4th, the CPUC filed a motion with FERC to adopt the form of protective order that the CPUC entered, to compel the production of documents and to shorten time to answer. According to Exhibit B (read to me by Nancy Pickover at Bracewell) the following CPUC moved against the following entities: AES, Williams, Duke, Dynegy, Reliant and Southern. Enron entities were NOT named in exhibit B. This is not to say that we could not be easily added to the group. While the motion reads as if the CPUC was moving against everybody, in fact, in footnote 2 they state they are only moving against the entities named in Exhibit B. We will have Exhibit B in hand first thing tomorrow via FEDEX to confirm this. To repeat, Enron is not named yet.

Donnelly could lead to a= =20 mass exodus by hundreds of small energy producers that have been selling=20 power to the state's financially troubled utilities for months without=20 getting paid. ?????At the same time, it may have staved off plans by a group of the small= =20 generators to send Edison into involuntary bankruptcy as early as today. ?????In Sacramento, energy legislation pushed by Gov. Gray Davis passed in= =20 the state Senate but foundered in the Assembly. The measure was intended to= =20 ensure that the state gets repaid for the electricity that it has been buyi= ng=20 on behalf of Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric, which say they lack the cas= h=20 and credit to purchase power. The bill also was supposed to guarantee that= =20 the small, alternative energy producers--which together provide nearly a=20 third of the state's power--get paid. But Assembly Republicans opposed it,= =20 saying it hadn't been given sufficient scrutiny. ?????The impact of the small producers was made clear in Imperial County,= =20 where Edison's failure to pay CalEnergy, the county's biggest property=20 taxpayer, had outsize implications. CalEnergy had put county officials on= =20 notice that it was about to miss a $3.8-million property tax payment. The= =20 uncertainty had prompted the tiny Calipatria Unified School District to=20 postpone a bond issue for badly needed school repairs. ?????Among CalEnergy Chairman David Sokol's first acts after the judge's=20 ruling Thursday was to promise Imperial County Supervisor Wally J. Leimgrub= er=20 that the company would pay its property taxes on time. ?????\"That is great news,\" Leimgruber said. ?????Within hours of its court victory, CalEnergy had stopped transmitting= =20 geothermal power to Edison and begun selling it to El Paso Energy, a=20 marketing company that purchased the energy at prevailing rates and resold = it=20 on the spot market. ?????Some of the more than 700 other small energy producers in the state sa= id=20 they were considering similar action against Edison and Pacific Gas &=20 Electric. ?????\"We absolutely need the right to sell to third parties,\" said Dean=20 Vanech, president of Delta Power, a New Jersey company that owns five small= =20 gas-fired plants in California and is owed tens of millions of dollars by= =20 Edison. ?????Sokol praised the Imperial County judge and said his company simply=20 wanted the authority to sell its power \"to a credit-worthy company that, in= =20 fact, pays for the power.\" ?????An Edison spokesman said the company was disappointed with the ruling,= =20 but sympathized with CalEnergy and other small producers because=20 \"California's power crisis has placed [them] in financial distress, just as= =20 it has placed utilities in financial distress.\" ?????Edison expressed concern that the ruling would prompt CalEnergy and=20 other small producers to sell their power out of state. Sokol said CalEnerg= y=20 had specifically told El Paso Energy that it hoped its power would remain i= n=20 California, \"but if someone wants to pay a higher price out of state, we=20 can't stop them.\" ?????Sokol said that Edison still owes CalEnergy $140 million and that the= =20 company--along with seven other small producers--had been prepared to file = a=20 petition in federal bankruptcy court in Los Angeles today forcing the utili= ty=20 into involuntary bankruptcy. He said his company no longer intends to do so= ,=20 and he believed--but wasn't certain--that the other companies would shelve= =20 their plans. ?????Edison filed papers Thursday with the federal Securities and Exchange= =20 Commission showing that it owed $840 million to various small electricity= =20 producers, many of which rely on renewable energy sources such as geotherma= l=20 steam, solar energy or wind. ?????The alternative energy producers--and utilities--strenuously objected = to=20 the legislation considered in Sacramento on Thursday. The bill, spelling ou= t=20 how the utilities are to pay the state and the small producers, passed the= =20 Senate on a 27-9 vote, the exact two-thirds margin required. But it stalled= =20 in the Assembly on a 46-23 party-line vote, well short of two-thirds. ?????\"When I was a citizen back in Lancaster, I heard these stories about= =20 pieces of legislation that were cooked up late at night, that . . . were cu= t=20 and pasted together and were rammed through by the Legislature,\" Assemblyma= n=20 George Runner (R-Lancaster) said. \"That's exactly what we have before us.\" ?????The alternative electricity generators, including oil companies, warne= d=20 that they would lose money under the Davis proposal, while representatives = of=20 Edison and PG&E, which have amassed billions in debt in the worsening energ= y=20 crisis, said the legislation would push them deeper into the hole. ?????\"There isn't enough money,\" Edison attorney Ann Cohn testified at a=20 Senate hearing on the bill Thursday. \"It is a very simple question: Dollars= =20 going out cannot be greater than dollars coming in.\" ?????The bill, AB 8X, combined several proposals. First, it sought to clari= fy=20 earlier legislation by spelling out that Edison and PG&E must pay the state= =20 all money collected from consumers for electricity that the state has been= =20 buying. ?????Additionally, the bill would turn over to the California Public=20 Utilities Commission the thorny issue of how much to pay alternative energy= =20 producers for their electricity. ?????Wind, solar and geothermal producers might agree to the prices offered= =20 by the administration.

Portland, Ore.-Based Firm Says California Has Capacity for Electricity Needs Dan McSwain , North County Times, Escondido, Calif. ( October 17, 2000 ) Oct. 13--PORTLAND, Ore.--A private investigation of state power markets has come to the conclusion that California had plenty of electricity generating capacity this summer. The state enjoyed a 32 percent reserve margin even as wholesale prices soared and the state's power manager declared 36 separate \"power emergencies\" because California was thought to be in the grips of a critical shortage, according to the investigation. The author of the investigation's preliminary report, Portland-based economist and utility industry consultant Robert McCullough, said at a conference of analysts, power traders and electricity industry regulators Thursday that he has found evidence that generators and trading companies manipulated the production of power from June through August to create a false shortage and push up prices. The Encina power plant in Carlsbad provides a stark example: it ran at well below its full capacity for much of June, even though wholesale power prices ---- and consumer electricity bills ---- shot to well above the generating plant's cost of production. The actual production of electricity by the plants was determined by an analysis of data from the Environmental Protection Agency, which monitors emissions. \"We are seeing a lot of under-generation,\" McCullough said. \"This is market power in action.\" Market power is a term used by economists to describe the ability of market participants -- in this case suppliers -- to influence prices. Many of the industry experts present at the conference Thursday reaffirmed their belief that supply shortages were very real this summer, and contributed to high prices, but several participants said deregulation has reduced the amount of market information that is available to analysts. Mainstream economists have questioned the accuracy of data from federal agencies, including the EPA. Conventional explanations for the low energy production observed in San Diego County are scant. Encina's operators, a joint venture of energy giants Dynegy Inc. and NRG Energy Inc. called Cabrillo Power, confirmed that the power plant had no abnormal maintenance problems. The San Diego Regional Air Quality Board said Wednesday that the power plant was well within its state-mandated pollution limits. But David Lloyd, the corporate secretary of Cabrillo, denied that the Encina plant has been used to game the San Diego County power markets. \"That can't possibly be right,\" Lloyd said of McCullough's analysis. \"In North County, we were right on the ragged edge of being off (an emergency shutdown because of heavy output). \"Without knowing the specific details of time and which units were on or off, I can't comment,\" Lloyd said. \"We certainly don't want to be accused of anything wrongful,\" he said. \"We don't have that much power in California, and for us to be shutting down in California to push up the price somewhere else doesn't make sense for us. We want to run all we can when the prices are high.\" Electricity prices have soared to record levels since May, resulting in a doubling and tripling of power bills this summer for the 1.2 million customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Co. and causing an estimated $5 billion in losses for Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. State lawmakers have intervened on behalf of San Diego County consumers with a retail rate cap, but the law in turn created a looming IOU that could grow beyond $300 million if high wholesale prices persist. No fewer than five private, state and federal investigations are under way to assess the competitiveness of power markets in the interconnected Western states. The investigations also seek to answer charges that the companies which produce and trade electricity have either figured out how to exploit deregulated markets to outmaneuver regulators or have engaged in outright manipulation in order to increase profits. Inquiries by the California Public Utilities Commission, Electricity Oversight Board and attorney general, along with a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission investigation, were launched in July and August. Staff investigators of the state and federal commissions said this week that they are still in the process of issuing subpoenas and gathering market data. McCullough was hired in late May by the Seattle city utility and a consortium of large industrial power consumers in the Pacific Northwest to investigate the price spikes. His effort is thought to be the first to complete an exhaustive analysis of state and federal information that tracks the amount of electricity that was available and compares it to the amount of power that was actually used. Chief among McCullough's findings was that demand for power was lower this summer than what was forecasted by the Western Systems Coordinating Council, a federal agency that is charged with ensuring the stability of the vast web of power transmission lines that connect California to 13 other Western states, British Columbia and northern Mexico. McCullough provided a copy of his preliminary findings Tuesday to the North County Times, and the initial reaction of the state's energy community was one of deep skepticism. \"EPA data is notoriously unreliable,\" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford professor and the chairman of the market surveillance committee of the California Independent System Operator, the agency that manages the state grid and which has paid enormous sums for emergency power this summer. To gauge the actual output of power plants that burn fossil fuel, McCullough used emissions data from the EPA. \"Greed would get the best of anybody,\" Wolak said. \"I found a lot of hours where in-state generators were exceeding nameplate capacity. These guys were cranking it out.\" Wolak, in a study of power markets for the system operator, did conclude, however, that exercise of market power by power generators and traders was the major cause of higher prices this summer. At the conference in Portland, most of the panelists did not openly criticize McCullough's analysis, but implicitly disputed his conclusions by attributing higher prices and the presumed exercise of market power to a very real shortage of electricity generating capacity among the Western states. Low hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest and high temperatures in the Southwest were blamed for limiting California's ability to import electricity. Others said state and federal regulators, along with market participants themselves, won't really know what happened until more experts look at hard market information that is in short supply. Ron Eachus, the chairman of the Oregon Public Utilities Commission, said market information is routinely withheld from regulators, the public and buyers of electricity, but is shared among power generators and trading companies. \"If the market is sharing it with themselves, but not us, I don't buy that,\" Eachus said. Tim Belden is the vice president of West Trading for Enron North America, the largest marketer and trader of electricity in the world. Enron takes the unique stand that more information which has been labeled \"proprietary\" by companies, such as when a plant is being run and how much the electricity is selling for, should be made available instantly to the markets. \"Is there a smoking gun out there or are market participants behaving rationally?\" Belden said. \"California is characterized by secret, black box market models that nobody understands,\" he said. \"If you've got nothing to hide, release the data.\" ----- To see more of the North County Times, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.nctimes.com (c) 2000, North County Times, Escondido, Calif.

Best, Jeff Financial California Changes Stance on Refunds; Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks Peter Behr ? 07/06/2001 The Washington Post FINAL Page E01 Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis. \"We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion,\" Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. \"You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion.\" The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close to the negotiations. Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise. \"What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood,\" Wagner told reporters. \"In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment.\" The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday. Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility, drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn, chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said. Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides, is closed to the public and media. Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a \"joke\" that the parties might as well wear \"clown suits,\" according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks. But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure, some energy analysts believe. Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile \"spot market\" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so did the state's electricity bills. In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy analysts say. A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a \"refund\" because the deals were reached \"under commercial duress,\" according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. \"There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be,\" said Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a \"just and reasonable\" standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. \"It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate,\" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room \"billions of dollars apart,\" as the talks approached their final weekend, sources said.", "flagged": 0}

CASE SETTING: 2000, U.S. In October 2000, the chief financial officer of Pacific Northwest Electric (PNW) is considering whether to use weather derivatives to reduce the weather-related risk in the volume of megawatt hours (MWh) sold. The (A) case may be used to stimulate student discussion of how the derivative contracts work, why one might want or not want to take such a contract, and how one would decide whether to use the weather protection. No prior exposure to options or derivatives is needed for this discussion; indeed, the case may be used as an introduction to options. The (B) case involves valuing the available contracts and deciding, which, if any, is the best contract for PNW. Spreadsheet simulation can be used to determine the probability distribution of the payout of the contract and the probability distribution for the net operating contribution including the contract payout, which is the basis for comparing alternatives. It is instructive for the students to think about what would be the ideal contract to reduce exposure to the greatest intent. This pushes students towards the optimal hedge ratio. Specific learning objectives of these cases include these: - to expose students to the cutting edge in financial innovation - to illustrate the use of options to reduce business risk - to challenge the students to value options where the Black-Scholes model cannot be used, and simulation can be readily employed - to experience the perspective of top management in risk management activities.

Davis's Plan To Power California --- State's Outlays for Electricity May Be Hard to Recover Without Rate Increases --- Betting on Long-Term Deals ------------------------ Breakthrough made in rescue of PG&E State ready to pay $7 billion for lines By Steve Geissinger SACRAMENTO BUREAU SACRAMENTO -- Signaling a breakthrough in secret energy crisis talks, the Davis administration disclosed Tuesday it may announce the framework of a pact to rescue the teetering Pacific Gas and Electric Co. next week. \"Things are going very well,\" said Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis. The state appears to be poised to pay at least $7 billion -- and possibly billions more -- for PG&E's high-voltage transmission lines as part of a deal to financially renovate the north-state utility, according to sources familiar with the negotiations. But consumer advocates insisted that even the $7 billion price is too much to pay. And experts warned that a deal with PG&E will be more complex than with other utilities. PG&E representatives declined comment, in keeping with their policy on the talks, even though the Davis administration said an announcement could come as early as next week or the following week. The new timetable for an announcement was substantially sooner than in Davis' original forecast. Until late last week, PG&E was still resisting the sale of its power grid despite the fact that Davis had announced the framework of an agreement with Southern California Edison. Davis expects to soon announce a similar deal with the San Diego Gas and Electric Co. However, any such deal still would need federal approval. The investor-owned utilities, trapped between high wholesale costs and lower, regulated retail rates, amassed nearly $13 billion in debts and were unable to buy electricity this winter. With the onset of rolling blackouts, the state began brokering billions of dollars in emergency short- and long-term power purchases. Davis' strategy to ease the energy price and supply crisis includes bolstering both conservation and generation while fiscally refurbishing the nearly bankrupt utilities. As part of the rescue deal, the utilities would have to drop legal actions seeking dramatically higher electricity bills, environmentally shield wildlands they own, sell power from their generators to Californians for the next decade and secure help with their debts from their parent companies. Together with the cash infusion from the sale of their power 26,000-mile power grids, the utilities would be allowed to sell bonds to raise funds and use customer money to pay them off. The state would upgrade the high-voltage lines and lease them back to the utilities for operation. In a reflection of the negotiations with the three utilities, a Davis administration official said the deal with PG&E is proving to be more complex than with the other firms. Though PG&E finally agreed late last week to sell its transmission grid, the utility apparently wants more than the $7 billion that Davis has offered, according to sources. The figure is more than twice the book amount, or the value placed on the system for purposes of accounting. And that's the markup that lured Edison into an agreement to sell its smaller portion of the transmission grid for $2.8 billion. But PG&E, which fears an erosion of its economic base, may be asking as much as $10 billion. Due to complexities in the state's 1996 deregulation of the industry, PG&E is more likely to lose revenue than Edison as a result of selling its transmission lines, according to experts. Big customers might be able to bypass the utility's remaining local distribution lines, thereby eroding its customer base. Therefore the utility may view bankruptcy, and sale of its transmission lines to the highest bidder, as a potentially attractive alternative to selling its share of the grid to the state at too low a price. ---- El Paso Energy closes six valley power plants Filed: 03/07/2001 By CHIP POWER, Californian staff writer e-mail: ppower@bakersfield.com El Paso Energy, citing non-payment from Pacific Gas & Electric Co., said it has shut down six cogeneration plants this week. The smaller plants produced about 175 megawatts of electricity and are located primarily in the San Joaquin Valley, said company spokesman Mel Scott. A megawatt can supply power to 1,000 homes. At least 10 plants have closed in the past two weeks as a result of non-payment, according to the state Independent System Operator, which manages most of the state's electrical distribution. The El Paso Energy plants are operated with various partners and had not been compensated for December, January and February deliveries, said Scott. He said he did not know the total amount due but said the plants would be closed until PG&E's credit worthiness is improved. A cogeneration plant, common in oil fields, simultaneously produces heat energy and electrical or mechanical power from the same fuel in the same facility. Typically, it produces electricity and steam, which can be deployed to enhance oil recovery. Kern County is the state's leading oil-producing county. El Paso owns or has interests in more than 40,000 miles of interstate and intrastate pipeline connecting the nation's principal natural gas supply regions to the five largest consuming regions in the United States, namely the Gulf Coast, California, the Northeast, the Midwest and the Southeast. El Paso closed up 99 cents on Tuesday, or 1.4 percent, at $71.49. The Houston-based company's stock price has ranged between $36.31 and $75.30 in the last 52 weeks. ---- Still undecided: Who'll pay DWR for electricity By Karen Gaudette ASSOCIATED PRESS SAN FRANCISCO -- The price tag is $3.2 billion and counting for electricity bought by the state Department of Water Resources for the customers of two nearly bankrupt utilities. Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison and the state disagree over how the DWR eventually will be reimbursed for its purchases on the expensive last-minute power market. So do the state power regulators, who have the final call over who gets the money when. Under a recent law, the DWR went into the electricity-buying business to help keep the two utilities from sinking further into their $13 billion debt. The state plans to retrieve the money by selling $10 billion in revenue bonds. The utilities continue to collect ratepayer dollars on that electricity, which the bill's author, Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, says is meant to help them begin paying down their debt. In a recent letter, however, DWR officials requested that the state Public Utilities Commission order that a portion of that money be diverted to the state. But after the utilities subtract the costs of generating electricity, payments to environmentally friendly power plants and other expenses, there is no money left from ratepayer dollars to give to the DWR without sinking further into debt, PG&E spokesman Ron Low said Tuesday. If it passed along money to the DWR, \"our undercollection would grow by about $2.4 billion by the end of the year,\" Low said. The commission, unable to agree on the best course of action, left the issue untouched at its last meeting but expects to revisit the issue when it meets this morning. Commissioner Richard Bilas is proposing an alternate plan that would have the DWR set its own revenue requirements that would be passed on to ratepayers. The PUC also is expected to respond to complaints from laid-off workers and customers that layoffs by utilities to cut costs have been hurting service. Commissioner Carl Wood warned at the last meeting that failure to provide safe and reliable service could mean fines for the utilities. Representatives from electrical workers unions, the PUC and the utilities were to discuss the issue Tuesday afternoon. \"I don't think we believe that utilities can find a way out of their problems by laying off workers,\" said Mindy Spatt, a spokeswoman with the Utility Reform Network. \"We think consumers deserve safe and reliable service, and we think they deserve it at a reasonable price.\" ---- State Taxpayers In Dark on Details Of Energy Deal David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday, March 7, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Few people would purchase a car simply because the dealer said, ''Trust me, it's a great deal.'' Yet Gov. Gray Davis essentially is telling Californians just that about dozens of long-term power contracts. Because of confidentiality agreements with power companies, the governor has revealed only scant details about the state's multibillion-dollar contracts for electricity over the next 10 years. \"Gov. Davis has our money, and we can't see how he's spending it,\" said Doug Heller, a spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. \"We've been locked out of the room.\" Neither Davis nor power companies would divulge specific details about the price, duration or scope of individual contracts. Each cited secrecy clauses that the governor's office said had been desired by both sides. What consumers do know is this: -- California has signed 40 contracts and tentative accords, valued at about $40 billion, to secure enough power to light 9 million homes over the next decade. -- The average purchase price of each deal is $69 per megawatt hour -- well above the $30 to $40 charged by power generators before California's energy market went haywire last summer. -- If, as is widely expected, wholesale power prices fall in years ahead, the state nevertheless will be locked into paying above-market rates for electricity. But it is not known which generator agreed to part with the most power at the cheapest level or the full range of the prices in concocting the $69 average. Moreover, it is unclear how shrewdly the state negotiated with taxpayer money in securing power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities. \"These agreements are the bedrock of our long-term energy policy,\" Davis said Monday in announcing the deals. The governor's office defended the murky nature of the contracts yesterday. \"It's a business transaction in which private corporate information is included,\" said Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Davis. \"That's the kind of information that never gets revealed.\" While additional elements of the contracts will be publicized in coming months, he said, the contracts themselves will remain a secret. \"You'll never see all the details,\" Maviglio said. This did not sit well with many observers. \"It's a breach of public trust,\" said Daniel Bacon, a San Francisco attorney specializing in business law. \"A public servant spending public money shouldn't be able to keep the spending secret.\" But Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an energy-industry association in Menlo Park, called confidentiality agreements \"a necessary evil in transactions like this.\" He explained that no power company would agree to a long-term contract if rival firms could learn the terms of the accord. The company would be losing too much of its competitive edge in the marketplace, Ackerman said. At the same time, he noted that secrecy allowed the buyer -- in this case, California taxpayers -- to secure more favorable terms with individual sellers. A high price with one generator would not necessarily be sought by all power providers. Still, the fact that public funds are being used makes confidentiality in this case a different matter than, say, Cisco Systems' quietly negotiating to take over yet another tech rival. \"The public is in a very awkward position,\" said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. \"It has to rely on the good word and expertise of the governor, and he has yet to demonstrate that he has expertise or good word in this field.\" Shames likened consumers to passengers in a plane being flown by a pilot without a license to fly. \"But what choice do we have?\" he asked. \"I don't see many other options available right now.\" There's the rub. No matter how bad a deal California may have cut to help meet its energy demands, the alternative -- blackouts, disruptions, economic catastrophe -- is far, far worse. On the other hand, it already appears that the new contracts will not shield Californians from the threat of daily outages this summer, when demand surges. Davis said only about 60 percent of the state's summertime electricity needs so far had been met. Part of the reason is that many power companies already have contracted for their output this year. Duke Energy said this was why it would not begin its nine-year contract with California until 2002, while Williams Cos. said it would only gradually increase the amount of available wattage in its 10-year contract. Both companies, meanwhile, will continue to profit this summer by selling into the volatile \"spot\" market, where wholesale power went for as much as $1, 500 per megawatt hour last year. \"You can't sell all your power into long-term contracts,\" said Paula Hall- Collins, a Williams spokeswoman. \"You save some for the spot market.\" Consumer groups worry that consumers will be hammered again this summer with sky-high power prices, and then get nailed down the road by contracts for above-market rates. \"If we could look at the terms of the deals, we'd see that California is being gouged for 10 years,\" said Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. \"But the governor doesn't want us to see that.\" Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum said the state had gotten the best rates it could under current market conditions. \"California went for long-term contracts when everyone else moved in as well,\" he said. \"Californians are paying a price for not acting sooner.\" ---- Lawmakers pitch fixes for region's energy woes By David Whitney Bee Washington Bureau (Published March 7, 2001) WASHINGTON -- California members of Congress pleaded for everything from wholesale price caps to extending daylight-saving time an extra hour to help the region cope this summer with its persistent electricity shortage, but none of the ideas seemed to catch fire at a House hearing Tuesday. \"People will die in California because of this crisis,\" Rep. Brad Sherman, a Los Angeles-area Republican, warned the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Sherman testified that his idea for saving lives is to extend daylight-saving time by an extra hour, so that there would be more daylight at the end of the day when power consumption surges. \"One of the peak demand periods for electricity occurs between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m., when the sun sets and people come home from work,\" Sherman testified. \"If people come home and it is light out, there is less of an inclination to turn a light on.\" Sherman said the state Legislature has called for congressional approval for states to be given authority to extend daylight-saving time, and he cited analyses by the California Energy Commission and other agencies suggesting that it could cut power consumption by 1 percent to 2 percent. Sherman, who was one of about a dozen California lawmakers presenting their views on the energy squeeze, drew no questions from committee leaders about what his legislation might do to everything from airline schedules to television programming if West Coast states didn't agree on the same time standard. Most of the committee's questioning was on the more popular idea proposed by several California and Western lawmakers, primarily Democrats, to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose caps on wholesale electricity prices that have gone wild because of a regional power shortage. Rep. Bob Filner, D-San Diego, charged that the price spiral has little to do with power shortages but a lot to do with a \"small cartel\" of generators bilking ratepayers. Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., said he brought up the idea of regional price caps with President Bush, who was initially skeptical. But Inslee said that Bush warmed to the idea after being told that protections could be built into the caps so as not to discourage construction of new power plants. Upon hearing that, Inslee said, Bush invited him to meet with the president's Cabinet-level task force led by Vice President Dick Cheney on a national energy strategy. But Inslee said he can't get the group to meet with him. \"It's very disappointing,\" Inslee said. Tuesday's hearing was part of a series the panel is holding on the California crisis, so far without any emerging consensus on what, if anything, Congress should do. ---- Power plan called wrong Wall Street analysts say the governor's approach to the problem avoids the issue that caused the imbalance. March 7, 2001 By DON THOMPSON The Associated Press SACRAMENTO California's scramble to insulate consumers from the soaring price of electricity may add to the state's power problems this summer, Wall Street analysts said Tuesday. Gov. Gray Davis' emphasis on buying utilities' transmission lines and negotiating long-term power contracts to help ease their debts skirts the deep imbalance between wholesale and market rates that led to the state's power problems in the first place, they said. \"In the long run, it doesn't solve anything,\" said Michael Worms, an industry analyst for Gerard Klauer Mattison & Co. \"In the long run, you need to send the right price signals to consumers, which will create its own conservation signals. Unfortunately, customers were shielded from that in California.\" Davis said Monday that the state's first contracts to buy electricity for two financially struggling utilities will provide only about two-thirds of the power needed on a typical summer day, forcing Californians to cut power use at least 10 percent to avoid blackouts. Since early January, the state has been buying one- third of the power Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers need. The two utilities, denied credit by suppliers, say they have lost nearly $14 billion due to soaring wholesale electricity prices that the state's industry-deregulation law says they cannot pass on to consumers. The keepers of the state power grid had enough electricity Tuesday to avoid declaring an electricity alert, but have faced an almost-daily scramble for weeks due to a tight supply and high wholesale prices. Several wholesale and retail rate proposals are circulating. Among them: Free-market advocates such as Worms want an immediate end to the deregulation-imposed retail rate freeze on Edison and PG&E that will expire next year. Davis wants a Western price cap of $100 per megawatt hour on power generators he says have been prof iteering from California's short energy supply. The Bush administration and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission are cool to that idea. In December, FERC imposed a \"soft cap\" of $150 per megawatt hour on wholesale rates in the state and required suppliers to justify any higher prices they charge. Consumer groups such as The Utility Reform Network, or TURN, want regulated rates for residential and small-business customers, but free-market rates for large industrial customers, which sought deregulation in the first place. TURN also advocates a tiered rate structure, with higher rates for consumers who use more than a reasonable amount of electricity each month. Assembly Republicans say electricity and natural-gas prices will fall naturally if the state increases supply, mainly by making it easier to build plants and pipelines. \"Right now, you're sort of sitting partially with regulation and part with the free market,\" said Paul Fremont, an analyst with Jefferies & Co. \"Both these systems work. It's sort of that in-between system that you have in Califor nia that doesn't appear to be working.\" The system discourages generators from building new power plants because they aren't guaranteed a profit, and it doesn't do enough to discourage power use by consumers because the price they pay doesn't reflect the true cost of power, Fremont said. \"I don't think people here have much faith in the market, and why should they?\" countered TURN's Mindy Spatt. \"I think there are probably better ways of encouraging consumers to conserve than by gouging them.\" Davis insists the crisis can be resolved without raising rates for Edison and PG&E customers beyond \"the existing rate structure.\" In January, state regulators imposed temporary rate hikes of 7 to 15 percent on Edison and PG&E customers. The Legislature and Davis extended the increases for up to a decade to help pay back the estimated $10 billion in power buying the state expects to do for Edison and PG&E over the next several years, and finance its purchase of the power lines owned by the two companies and San Diego Gas & Electric. Rates were already scheduled to increase next year for Edison and PG&E customers. Under the 1996 deregulation law, the pair's ratepayers saw a 10 percent rate reduction, but only until early 2002. That rate cut will likely expire as planned, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio has said. Davis wants those rates to cover not only the traditional cost of generating, transporting and distributing power, but the added cost of paying off the two utilities' massive debt and buying their transmission lines, said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, the Assembly's chief power negotiator. Yet Davis has indirectly addressed the rate imbalance by signing legislation that will let regulators raise consumer rates if necessary, Keeley said. The governor and lawmakers are in effect spreading out rate increases over a decade by using long-term revenue bonds to buy power for the nearly bankrupt utilities, said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute. \"At some point we have to deal with the reality that all of the power that we buy has to be paid for by somebody - it's either going to come from taxpayers or it's going to come from ratepayers,\" Bor enstein said. \"Raising rates now would get us a lot of conservation.\" Davis also wants financial incentives for conservation and power-plant construction in time to make a difference this summer. \"Our mouths were agape\" at the rapid timetable, Keeley said. Legislators are rushing to pass those incentives by month's end, he said, allowing three months for consumers and suppliers to act before the heat of summer. Among bills considered Tuesday, the Senate Energy Committee approved legislation to accelerate the siting of power plants. It also was considering a proposal to restructure rates for generators that use renewable energy to provide about 30 percent of the state's electricity. ---- Bill to Cut Some Power Prices Stalls Energy: Democrats balk at varying payment levels for alternative generators. By DAN MORAIN, JULIE TAMAKI, Times Staff Writers SACRAMENTO--Legislation aimed at cutting prices for more than a fourth of the power consumed in California stalled Tuesday, as Democrats questioned why a few alternative energy generators--some of them campaign donors--stood to receive higher payments than others. Lawmakers working to unravel California's energy mess have been negotiating for weeks in an effort to cut the price paid to more than 600 generators of alternative power by more than half, to below 8 cents a kilowatt-hour. Those alternative generators' contracts with utilities have shot up in recent months because of a rise in the price of natural gas. The cash-strapped corporations have suspended or made partial payments to the generators over the last few months, causing many to shut down or reduce their outputs. But even as the lawmakers reached agreement that pushed the average price to near the 8-cent level per kilowatt-hour, some generators would have received higher prices under the bill by state Sen. Jim Battin (R-La Quinta). Some of the generators that stood to benefit had donated to Battin's campaigns. One--Windtec Inc.--gave Battin a $20,000 campaign donation in 1999. Others contributed from $3,000 and $5,000 last year. Battin acknowledged that he has received campaign contributions from some wind power generators but said there is no connection between the donations and the bill's provisions. \"It is illegal, it is unethical and it's not how I do business,\" he said. Battin noted that 25% of the state's alternative energy producers are in his district. As Democrats on the Senate Energy Committee blocked the bill, Battin warned that some alternative energy producers might react to the delay by trying to force Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric into bankruptcy. \"We will be the cause of bankruptcy,\" Battin said. That prompted Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) to retort: \"I'm really tired of being threatened with bankruptcy.\" Alternative energy producers, including those that use wind, solar power, biomass and other means, produce 27% of the energy used in California. They sell the electricity to the utilities, which in turn transmit it to retail consumers. But with the utilities facing multibillion-dollar debts, the alternative energy producers under contract with Edison have not been paid since November. Scores of alternative energy producers supported the measure. Edison International and the San Francisco-based consumer group, the Utility Reform Network, opposed it. Michael Florio of the Utility Reform group said the deal could result in higher consumer prices; an Edison representative said the same thing. Battin and Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek) worked out an arrangement with many of the generators. Keeley took the lead in the early negotiations, and then turned to Battin to introduce the legislation, SB 47X. Rather convoluted language would have allowed higher payments to a select few generators that produce electricity from wind and biomass. Most of California's wind suppliers, for instance, would have received about 6 cents per kilowatt-hour. But a handful of them, about half a dozen wind farms--mostly in the Palm Springs area represented by Battin--would have received 7.8 cents. Battin contends that other wind producers receive additional payments that boost them to the same level as Windtec and others that would get the higher payments. \"They get the same deal,\" Battin said of the handful of generators that would benefit from the provisions he added to the bill. In California's overall energy market, the amount of money that would have flowed to the favored generators is minor. But the added prices that would have been paid to the generators would have translated to at least $19 million in the next five years, to be absorbed by Southern California Edison customers, according to one analysis. Also Tuesday, more details were disclosed about another leg of the state's effort to escape from the energy crunch--the deals with large power generators to supply electricity to California for as long as 10 years. Those arrangements were announced by Gov. Gray Davis Monday as \"the bedrock\" of California's energy policy. But some consumer advocates warned that the deals could lock the state into excessively high-priced contracts. S. David Freeman, the general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Davis' negotiator, said that the state guarded against that by varying the time spans of its deals. About 6,000 megawatts are expected to be available this summer, about one-third of the energy needed by the state, Freeman said. The amount of power under contract swells until more than 9,000 megawatts are contracted in 2004, half of the needed amount, before dipping to 8,000 megawatts in 2010. \"What we're doing here is what everybody said had to be done,\" Freeman said. \"We deliberately bought 50% so we'd have a good mix between long-term contracts, which may turn out to be somewhat higher or somewhat lower than the spot market,\" and purchases on the spot market. ---- PG&E could face mutiny on outages: SMUD, others may balk if utility orders summer blackouts By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer (Published March 7, 2001) Sacramento's electric utility wants out of a deal that imposes rolling blackouts locally on PG&E's command. So do a lot of other utilities. They've been writing letters, lobbying lawmakers and launching informal talks with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to get off the hook before summer. Who dodges the blackout bullet \"is going to play out as a political hot button\" around the state, said George Fraser, head of the Northern California Power Agency, a coalition of municipal utilities. In Sacramento, the next volley is expected soon, with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District reportedly poised to notify PG&E that it will no longer black out homes and businesses on the larger utility's command. \"We are absolutely trying to fight off the requirement for rolling blackouts for the Sacramento area,\" said Linda Davis, one of seven elected members of the SMUD board of directors. Saying they don't want to be dragged down by somebody else's problems, two Southern California utilities have written grid operators asking to be exempted from any blackouts caused by PG&E's or Southern California Edison's financial woes. But in PG&E's view, \"California is in an energy crisis (and) ... we're all in this together,\" said spokesman John Nelson. The maneuvering comes amid bleak forecasts for power supplies this summer. Although Gov. Gray Davis has said conservation, new power plants and moderate weather could avert blackouts, officials at the Independent System Operator, which runs much of California's grid, expect frequent rotating outages. One consulting firm, Cambridge Energy Research Associates, predicts 20 hours of rolling blackouts during July and August, and about 200 hours of especially intense calls for voluntary cutbacks. Before blackouts hit, the jockeying over just whose lights, air conditioners and assembly lines will be shut down is growing. The outcome could affect millions of people statewide. The state Public Utilities Commission is probing rolling blackout programs run by the for-profit utilities it regulates, including PG&E and Edison. A PUC analysis has suggested that PG&E's program, which currently exempts about 40 percent of its customers, should spread the burden more broadly. For example, it said, 1.9 million homes and businesses are spared just because they share a circuit with a customer deemed \"essential.\" But not-for-profit utilities such as SMUD, which answer to their own elected boards or city councils, have other worries. Many have already lined up their power supplies for summer. Some have raised rates or are considering raising rates. Some have taken extra conservation steps. They think those preparations ought to give them leverage to ease blackout clauses in their contracts with PG&E. SMUD general manager Jan Schori \"is going to use every avenue ... any avenue, to put pressure on,\" including lobbying the ISO, the governor and others, said utility director Davis. The Northern California Power Agency, a joint-powers authority that owns and operates power plants for municipal utilities, has begun informal negotiations with PG&E to change blackout rules, according to Fraser, its top executive. It is preparing to write PG&E, asking that its members be exempted from outages altogether. Failing that, it wants them to face fewer outages or to be compensated for cutting off power, he said. At SMUD, the utility board has met in closed session to discuss exactly what it is required to do during electric emergencies, under terms of the interconnection contract that links SMUD's lines to PG&E's. \"The contracts are being inspected with a fine-tooth comb,\" said SMUD director Howard Posner. Schori declined to comment on any specifics. Sources indicated that the main option being considered is notifying PG&E that because of changed circumstances, SMUD believes it no longer is required to routinely comply with outage requests. Other options being explored include re-negotiating existing agreements with PG&E. Posner said that ever since two days of rolling blackouts in January, constituents have been asking him, \" 'Why are we participating when we're not the problem?' And I don't have a good answer to that.\" Several directors said SMUD has already spent a lot of money -- and is considering 16 percent rate increases -- to ensure that it has enough electricity under contract to meet its customers' summer demands. They believe PG&E should do the same. \"We're almost like a David against Goliath here,\" said board vice president Genevieve Shiroma. \"The huge investor-owned utilities next door have severe problems that they need to get under control.\" In addition, SMUD plans to argue that because it can cut usage through its \"Peak Corps\" program, which remotely turns off air conditioners at volunteer households, it has already done its part without rotating outages, director Davis said. PG&E believes the interconnection agreements that govern smaller utilities' ties to its transmission lines have \"benefits and burdens to both sides,\" said Nelson. \"It wouldn't be fair or good policy for just one provision to be altered without taking a look at how that affects the entire contract,\" he said. Interconnection contracts generally have clauses that require utilities to help each other out to avert greater emergencies. Sometimes reducing demand -- called load shedding -- can be the only way to stabilize the electric grid in the seconds after a major power plant or transmission line fails. \"It's been around in the electrical fabric forever,\" said Jim Pope, head of Silicon Valley Power, Santa Clara's city-run utility. In addition to legal requirements, \"you have a moral obligation so you don't bring the system to collapse.\" Like other city-run utilities, Silicon Valley Power has a contract with PG&E that requires it to shed load during an electric emergency. But its contract allows it to work with big users to reduce their demand, so no one has to be completely shut off. Such agreements, formed long before deregulation when PG&E ran the north state's grid, now are complicated by the 1997 creation of the state Independent System Operator. The ISO today runs pieces of the grid owned by PG&E, Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. If it believes power use is about to surge past supply, potentially triggering a grid collapse across the western United States, the ISO notifies the three utilities that they have to shed a certain number of megawatts. The big utilities meet that requirement two ways. They cut circuits to some of their own customers, and they tell smaller, connected utilities to cut a proportionate share. In Northern California, about 80 percent of the outages are borne by PG&E customers and the rest by customers of SMUD and other municipal utilities and irrigation districts. \"In one sense, we are all in this together. If SMUD were in danger of going down, we would hope others would help us out,\" said SMUD's Posner. \"But that's if we're in danger from circumstances beyond our control, not from mismanagement or lack of financial wherewithal.\" It is unclear what penalties, if any, a utility would face for violating an interconnection agreement. In the long run, the issue would be fought either in the courts or before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, grid officials said. As a practical matter, in the seconds when the risk to the grid is greatest, if one utility refused to shed load, the ISO would probably solve to problem by calling on PG&E, Edison or others who are willing to make deeper cutbacks, they said. ---- PUC to Decide Fate Of Utility Workers PG&E, Edison want to trim costs by laying off thousands, cutting service Bernadette Tansey, Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday, March 7, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle State regulators are set to decide today whether debt-ridden Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison can conserve cash by laying off thousands of workers and letting service standards slip. Union officials who protested the layoffs before the California Public Utilities Commission warn that if the cuts go through, neighborhoods hit by power outages could stay dark for hours, and more customers could face busy signals when they call about their bills. An administrative law judge agreed, advising the commission in February to order the utilities to restore 725 positions already cut and block the elimination of an additional 2,125 jobs. Judge John Wong said PG&E and Edison have acknowledged the layoffs will not substantially improve their shaky financial condition, which arose from skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs the utilities could not pass on to consumers under a rate cap. \"The savings would barely make a dent,\" Wong said in his draft decision. The two companies together claim that their debt from power purchases amounts to more than $13 billion. PG&E says it has saved $18 million from the first wave of 325 layoffs. Wong's recommendation is already running into resistance on the PUC. Commissioner Richard Bilas said the five-member panel should not be micromanaging the utilities in a time of crisis. Bilas has proposed an alternate ruling that would allow the utilities to make the cuts, but provide for PUC monitoring of service in case the commission wants to step in later. \"We're in a situation where the utilities are not collecting the revenues they need to operate, and yet we may be guilty of not letting them cut expenses where they can cut expenses,\" Bilas said. PG&E spokesman Jon Tremayne said savings from the layoffs are helping to keep electricity running and gas flowing. \"It keeps cash in our accounts so we can keep doing day-to-day business,\" Tremayne said. In addition to the 325 positions dropped so far, PG&E is proposing to cut an additional 675 during the next three to six months. The cuts affect temporary and contract workers who read meters, handle new service hookups and replace equipment. PG&E has no plans to eliminate permanent positions. The company is struggling to keep up with a higher workload at its call center as customers deluge the lines with inquiries about their rising bills and the effects of deregulation. Calls to PG&E ballooned from 1.3 million in January 2000 to 2.3 million in January 2001. Bilas advocates granting PG&E's request to temporarily relax standards requiring the utility to respond swiftly to customer calls and to read customers' meters once a month. PG&E wants to read meters bimonthly and send bills based on the estimated use between readings. Discrepancies could be corrected later. Wong called those measures unacceptable. He said customers need to know immediately if their efforts to conserve power are working. Wong also said the utilities' own experts have said the workforce reductions will lengthen the time required to restore power after nonemergency equipment failure. Eric Wolfe, communications director for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 1245, said some customers have already been left without power overnight because PG&E is trying to avoid the use of overtime on nonemergency power outages. \"It hurts a lineman to walk away from the job leaving a customer without power,\" Wolfe said. Tremayne said PG&E is trying to minimize overtime costs, but denied the company has allowed customers to go without power out of financial concerns. He said crews were pulled out when darkness and falling trees made the work too dangerous. ---- Power prices could soar during the summer Posted at 10:35 p.m. PST Tuesday, March 6, 2001 BY STEVE JOHNSON Mercury News Unless Gov. Gray Davis arranges significantly more long-term electricity contracts or persuades people to turn off a lot more lights, California's unpredictable spot market for power could wreak havoc this summer. Even with the 40 long-term deals announced by Davis on Monday, experts interviewed Tuesday said, up to 43 percent of the state's daily needs may have to come from this highly volatile market, in which power is bought within a day of need. That could could prove hugely expensive, because some spot market energy has cost five to six times what it would under the long-term contracts. It's widely expected that consumers ultimately would have to pay that tab, which could amount to billions of dollars. And because that power won't be locked up in contracts, there is no guarantee it will be available when it's needed, which could lead to blackouts, according to a recent report to the California Independent System Operator, which oversees three-fourths of the state's power grid. ``The situation in California could reach catastrophic proportions,'' the report concluded, adding that unless things change dramatically, ``it is a virtual certainty that peak demand will go unmet during many hot summer days.'' Steven Maviglio, Davis' press secretary, conceded Tuesday that the spot market could be troublesome. ``It's a major concern,'' he said, which is why the state is trying to line up more power contracts, speed up power plant construction and promote conservation. During the normally hot month of August, peak daily demand for power in the Independent System Operator's territory is expected to hit about 47,700 megawatts -- enough for nearly 48 million homes. The state's three main utility firms generate about 8,200 megawatts and have long-term contracts from wind, solar and other energy sources for about 11,700 megawatts more. That totals about 20,000 megawatts. Add in the 7,000 megawatts of long-term power that Davis has announced for this summer, and the state is still nearly 21,000 megawatts short. Costly proposition If all that power has to be obtained on the spot market, the price could be high. On Friday, last-minute purchases on the market averaged $411 per megawatt-hour, compared to about $150 per megawatt-hour for all power obtained by the Independent System Operator and $69 per megawatt-hour on average under Davis' long-term contracts. It's possible that not all 21,000 megawatts would have to be purchased on the market. Assuming Davis is successful in getting people to save 10 percent -- which could prove difficult -- conservation could reduce peak demand by nearly 5,000 megawatts. California also might be able to trade for another 5,000 megawatts with the federal government's Bonneville Power Administration and a hydroelectric operator in British Columbia, said Arthur O'Donnell, editor of California Energy Markets, a trade publication. Under such deals, those two outfits often send that much power to California when they don't need it and California returns the same amount or more when its demand is low. But O'Donnell said it wasn't clear whether 5,000 megawatts would be available this summer, because ``they still haven't gotten the snowpack they need in the Pacific Northwest,'' which could limit that region's generating capacity. Still falling short Even if those hydropower imports are available and conservation works as Davis hopes, it's likely California would still require the spot market for 11,000 megawatts to meet the August demand. That's more than 20 percent of the state's overall power needs. ``All of the surrounding states are buying probably less than 5 percent, at most, of their energy on the spot market,'' said Frank Wolak, a Stanford economist, who monitors electricity prices for the Independent System Operator. He worries about how much that power could cost and is disturbed that state officials haven't adequately addressed the issue. ``No one has any idea what they are going to do, and that is part of the problem,'' he said. Officials at Pacific Gas & Electric Co. are particularly concerned. They fear that their company -- which is nearing bankruptcy -- could get stuck for much of the spot market purchases by the Independent System Operator, which has threatened to bill the utilities for the cost. Fearing the annual bill for that power could hit $2.4 billion this year, PG&E wants the tab sent to the Department of Water Resources, which also is buying power on the spot market for the state. But the Department of Water Resources has objected to that idea and the matter is expected to be heard today by the California Public Utilities Commission. ``We're looking for clarity on a number of issues'' regarding how the spot market will work ``and certainly that's one of them,'' said Thomas Hannigan, the water agency's director. ``I don't think anybody knows the answer of who's going to pay for it,'' added PG&E spokesman John Nelson. But Nettie Hoge, executive director of the Utility Reform Network in San Francisco, said she suspects consumers ultimately will foot the bill. The unfortunate likelihood about spot market purchases is that ``ratepayers are responsible for all of it eventually,'' Hoge said. ``It's a very big problem.'' ---- Power Plant Plans Cause Conflicts East county residents blast supervisors Jason B. Johnson, Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday, March 7, 2001 Industry dreams of building new power plants in east Contra Costa's hills are prompting an angry reaction among residents and elected officials who say they don't want more plants. The conflict was sparked by a vote by county supervisors yesterday to aggressively explore possible sites for new power plants throughout the county. The measure by Supervisors Mark DeSaulnier and Federal Glover, which passed on a 4-to-0 vote, directs the county administrator and Department of Community Development to compile a report on possible sites within 45 days. Supervisor Donna Gerber abstained after criticizing the plan for potentially repeating the same mistakes that plagued the state's energy deregulation effort by not considering how much energy the state, region and county will need in future years, and how much power is slated to come online. Gerber said alternative power sources, such as solar, should also be examined. A site drawing much attention is on top of a deposit of natural gas near the Concord Naval Weapons Station off Highway 4. The owners of 70 acres of land near the station recently formed a company, Golden State Power Co., to pursue construction of at least one small peaker plant and a much larger facility capable of producing 600 megawatts. The site could hold up to three small 50-megawatt peaker plants, and a larger 15-acre natural gas plant, said Steve Thomas, managing partner with Golden State. No land use applications have been filed. Thomas said 30 acres could be kept as open space to form a buffer around the project. \"Both (facilities) are state of the art,\" said Thomas. \"We believe that the site is ideal.\" But east county residents at yesterday's meeting blasted the supervisorial measure and the power plant proposal, complaining that more plants could put people's health at risk. The region already is home to six power plants. \"We're going to get a good dose of poor air quality and (negative) health conditions from this,\" said Concord resident Evelyn Frietas. \"I think we need to stop and think about what we're doing to our quality of life.\" Dan Torres said the home he bought in 1995 at a new Bay Point development would be alarmingly close to the proposed Golden State site. \"It will be dragging emissions over our home,\" said Torres. \"I didn't buy a home on that hill to be surrounded by power plants.\" There are six power plants in operation in east Contra Costa. Pittsburg already has two power plants, and two more under construction. City Council members Frank Aiello and Yvonne Beals said the Antioch-Pittsburg area has done more than its share of energy production. Aiello said Pittsburg will soon produce enough energy to power three million homes in California. \"When is enough, enough?\" asked Aiello. \"Pittsburg has shouldered responsibility for a land-fill and two more power plants. At some point you have to say enough.\" Beals said that while power plants have added millions to the city's general fund, the negatives of additional plants could outweigh the benefits. \"I don't think that Pittsburg or east county should be the dumping ground for energy for California,\" said Beals. ---- Supervisors set search for power plant sites The board also heard from the potential developers of a 650-megawatt plant between Bay Point and Concord By Thomas Peele TIMES STAFF WRITER MARTINEZ -- Contra Costa County supervisors took tentative steps Tuesday toward allowing the construction of at least one small power plant before summer, ordering that its staff identify potential sites in unincorporated areas within seven weeks. The board voted 4-0 to search for locations. Third District Supervisor Donna Gerber abstained, saying her colleagues lacked a \"comprehensive context'' to identify sites. \"I think the board knows just enough to be dangerous,'' she said. Gerber said the county should examine the potential for additional power plants within its borders but not investigate individual sites yet. But Fourth District Supervisor Mark DeSaulnier said the action was necessary because of the energy crisis and because of Gov. Gray Davis' call for local governments to help speed the construction of so-called \"peaker plants\" before July and August. \"I wouldn't do this except under an emergency,\" DeSaulnier said after the vote. \"There are unusual circumstances. We're not talking about putting this in a residential area.\" Fifth District Supervisor Federal Glover backed DeSaulnier, but said he hoped for a location outside his heavily industrialized East County district. \"There's a lot of concern in East County as to the number of plants,\" he said. DeSaulnier said, though, that the only logical place for a small plant remains the \"industrial belt'' stretching along the waterfront from West County to Antioch. He declined to provide specifics, but said the only other potential site outside the industrial areas was the Concord Naval Weapons Station property. But he quickly added that he believes the U.S. Department of Defense \"would never go for it.\" Also, DeSaulnier said he could not rule out the county building the plant itself and entering the electricity-selling market during peak demand times. Board Chairwoman Gayle Uilkema called that idea extremely premature and unlikely. \"That's a very powerful decision. I do not think we are ready,'' she said. The California Energy Commission listed the Equilon refinery in Martinez as one of 32 potential \"peaker plant\" sites in the state last week. Peaker plants kick in during peak usage times. Davis called for their quick construction before the height of summer and its energy demand for air conditioning. Plants that generate as much as 50,000 megawatts don't need Energy Commission approval. DeSaulnier said he believed a peaker plant could be built about a month after final approval. Supervisors also heard from the potential developers of a 650-megawatt plant between Bay Point and Concord. Walnut Creek commercial real estate developer Steve Thomas announced his intentions for the site north of Highway 4 last week. Construction could take two years. Eric Hasseltine, a consultant representing Thomas and what he described as a \"brand new\" company for the site, the Golden State Power Co., told supervisors that if they intended to speed peaker plant construction they should do what they can to expedite the larger plant. The Thomas site could house a peaker plant until the proposed larger one goes online. A large natural gas line passes under the site. DeSaulnier seemed cautious about the larger proposal, which he had described last week as \"a good site.\" Uilkema, too, said she knew too little about it to comment. A resident who lives near the Thomas property asked the board to \"build it (the larger plant) closer to where you have industrial areas. You have to carefully consider the people\" who live nearby, said Dan Torres, 39. Evelyn Freitas of Concord said she lives downwind of the proposed site. \"Our air quality is going to be worse then it is now,\" she said. Gerber played on the environmental issues, saying the county already ranks second statewide to Los Angeles in volume of hazardous materials and amount of electrical generation. ---- Peter Schrag: California's $90 billion infrastructure gap (Published March 7, 2001) By now, California's surreal energy mess has grown from a crisis to a condition. It may not be quite as permanent as, say, death and taxes, but it's still something that could get a whole lot worse before it gets better. Until there's more realistic pricing, no gubernatorial pea-under-the-shell buyout scheme will solve it. Beyond the energy crisis, however, and in many ways similar to it, California faces a whole range of other infrastructure problems -- in transportation, in water resources and sewer systems, in school and university buildings -- that seem, once again, to be all but forgotten. The Business Roundtable has estimated the need at roughly $90 billion, though no number can possibly be exact. What's certain is that after a burst of high-level investment in public facilities during the 1950s and 1960s, California's annual capital investment has sunk precipitously -- from an annual $150 per capita in the 1960s, according to a set of recent studies for PPIC, the Public Policy Institute of California, to about $30 in the 1990s. But you probably don't need to tell anyone driving Bay Area or Los Angeles freeways or looking at the ubiquitous portable classrooms, those dreary brown boxes that house a fourth of our public school students. Ever since passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, we have been flying the flag of deferred maintenance. As in the state's electricity crisis, however, there's no way California can effectively address those problems merely by building or bonding itself out of them. In highway construction, in developing water resources, in finding enough university space to accommodate the Tidal Wave II of students, managing demand is likely to be as crucial to any solution as new construction. In the energy market -- and in electricity particularly -- it's been a familiar principle ever since David Roe of the Environmental Defense Fund first persuaded Pacific Gas and Electric that a dollar invested in conservation may be worth as much as the same investment in new generation. But in most other sectors of California's infrastructure, state and local, it's a lesson still to be learned. There have been scattered attempts to encourage conservation and reduce demand -- significant reduction in water use, for example, through the installation of low-flow faucets and low-flush toilets; some reduction in traffic by using rush-hour diamond lanes or by adjusting highway or (as in New York) bridge tolls to levels of congestion. But as pointed out by David Dowall, an urban economist at Berkeley, state policy-makers have not really begun to \"consider how demand management strategies can be applied to infrastructure service areas,\" or how the more efficient use of facilities and more realistic pricing -- highway tolls, say, or parking fees -- \"can reduce demand for scarce infrastructure resources.\" In any case, says Dowall in one of the PPIC reports, we should pick which major projects we will build not just according to per capita estimates of how much we need, but according to how much consumers are willing to pay for them. To avoid hurting the poor, congestion-related highway tolls and other tariffs can be rebated on the basis of income. University fees can be means-tested. In California, they also could be adjusted to encourage summer school classes and other off-peak uses, rather than (as in the past) making UC summer courses more expensive. Given the political and economic uncertainties, there's no way to know how far such demand management can be taken. But there's not much doubt that, as Dowall and others point out, the state's infrastructure planning is a jumble of uncoordinated agency agendas and wish lists. The Legislature last year passed a bill, AB 1473, by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, that requires the governor, beginning next year, to submit an annual five-year infrastructure plan for state agencies and public schools, along with recommendations on how to fund it. In addition, Gov. Gray Davis' infrastructure commission is expected to recommend better coordination of infrastructure and land-use planning when it issues its report this spring. That would be a start. As California State Treasurer Phil Angelides has pointed out, the state desperately needs to start joint planning -- regional planning -- for housing, roads and other resources to reduce the need for long commutes; to preserve open space; and to bring jobs to where people live and housing to where the jobs are. That would itself reduce demand for more freeway lanes and, equally important, improve the quality of life. At present, most planning for housing, roads, water systems and other facilities rarely recognizes the regional impact of local decisions. In the East Bay, slow-growth forces push well-intended initiatives that would force more development into Tracy or Modesto and further tax the transportation systems to Silicon Valley. In city after city, there are beggar-thy-neighbor efforts to grab yet another shopping mall that produces a little extra sales tax revenue for the city that gets it, and that often compounds traffic and revenue problems in adjacent communities. In higher education we divide bond proceeds evenly among UC, the California State University and the community colleges even though the community colleges serve eight times as many students as UC. We plan road projects according to county, not regional, priorities. It is all done according to antiquated political and fiscal formulas that often no longer make sense. We don't just need better capital planning; we need a whole new planning system. ---- PG&E power plan debated at hearing A PUC meeting on the utility's capacity expansion project for the Tri-Valley follows weeks of protest from officials, residents Power upgrade in valley debated By Megan Long TIMES STAFF WRITER SAN FRANCISCO -- Dublin officials and the developer of a Livermore subdivision faced questions Tuesday about their opposition to alternative routes of PG&E's controversial Tri-Valley power upgrade plan -- and answered by restating their long-standing objections. Tuesday's cross-examination came during the third and likely final week of the California Public Utility Commission's evidentiary hearings on the utility's $91 million Tri-Valley 2002 Capacity Increase Project. It has followed weeks of protests of PG&E's upgrade plans by officials and residents of Livermore, Pleasanton, Dublin and San Ramon. And before the questioning started, Dublin Vice Mayor Janet Lockhart reiterated concerns about an alternative route deemed \"environmentally superior\" that would place a substation just 1,000 feet north of Interstate 580 between Tassajara and Fallon roads. She said that would undermine the results of a 15-year process to plan the eastern development of the city. \"It's extremely important to the residents of our community to follow a plan we worked hard to produce,\" she said. Dublin officials favor PG&E's proposed placement of the station three miles north of the freeway, away from new high-tech company offices and housing developments. Besides the Dublin substation, the project calls for construction of a substation in North Livermore, expansion of the Pleasanton substation and installation of 23.5 miles of new lines. In response to questions from PUC Administrative Law Judge Michelle Cooke, Dublin's public works director, Lee Thompson, confirmed that the Lin family, the owner of the property where the alternative substation would go, wasn't interested in selling the land to PG&E. Cooke also asked Thompson to define a \"discretionary permit,\" which is how city officials said they might treat a permit for a substation. Lee said that type of permit is one the city has the right to approve or not depending on the project's impact. Eddie Peabody, Dublin's community development director, testified that the zoning for the Lin property accommodates uses such as commercial business, research and development and light manufacturing. It would not, he said, be appropriate for a power substation. He said parcels within the East Dublin area that could host a station would include those zoned for public and semi-public uses, including land recently bought by Oracle and Sun Microsystems for new campuses. While Dublin officials testified that one buyer of land in that area paid $86 per square foot, others suggested land prices would be inflated to help make a PG&E land buy look prohibitively expensive. An executive of Centex Homes, the developer of new houses near Isabel Avenue and Concannon Boulevard, objected to an alternative route that would place high-voltage transmission lines overhead along Isabel and Stanley Boulevard. David Barclay, president of Centex's Northern California division, said that the 80-foot to 150-foot towers would have a severe visual impact on residents of the Prima tract. Ed O'Neill, a lawyer for the Kottinger Ranch Homeowners Association, pointed out that existing distribution lines on 50-foot poles on Isabel already mar the view for residents. The Foley family has been ranching on land south of Pleasanton city limits for years, said their attorney Kennedy Richardson. The utility's project would place overhead lines and a transmission station on rolling hills that the family envisions as one day being public open space with limited development, Richardson said. Lawyers for Pleasanton, Livermore, Kottinger Ranch and Centex are scheduled to cross-examine a PG&E engineer today about the project's routing. That testimony should be the most controversial of the hearings. Judge Cooke is expected to recommend an alignment by July to the PUC, which will make the final decision. ---- NEWS State OKs 'Peaker' Power Plant at SFO / Temporary generator could be sending electricity to 50,000 homes by August Marshall Wilson 03/08/2001 The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL Page A.20 (Copyright 2001) State energy officials yesterday approved plans to build a temporary electrical plant at San Francisco International Airport that should generate enough juice to power 50,000 homes by August. Meeting in Sacramento, the Energy Commission voted 4-0 to give the green light to the gas-fired plant. It will operate during peak summer and winter demand to help the state avoid Stage 3 power alerts and rolling blackouts. Texas-based El Paso Merchant Energy Co. won approval under a new state law mandating speedy, four-month reviews of so-called \"peaker\" plants. It was the only one of seven applications statewide to win approval. The other proposals were withdrawn for various reasons. The 51-megawatt plant, formally called the United Golden Gate Power Project, is scheduled to be built at the northwest corner of the airport near the United Airlines maintenance center. Within the next few weeks El Paso plans to apply to build a 571- megawatt, $400 million plant in the same area, company spokesman Jesse Frederick said. It would undergo a separate review by state energy officials. The small \"peaker\" plant approved yesterday is to generate electricity beginning around Aug. 1 for up to three years. After the end of three years, the plant would be closed or converted to a cleaner-burning system. Under state law, a temporary \"peaker\" plant is permitted to spew more air pollution than a permanent plant. El Paso's temporary plant is to be built next to a co-generation plant operated by United Airlines. It would use existing connections for natural gas and water supplies and tap into existing power transmission lines. Electricity generated by the plant would be pumped into the state's electrical grid, Energy Commission spokesman Gary Fay said. It would also serve as a backup for San Francisco Airport in case of a blackout. No one spoke against the proposed plant at yesterday's commission meeting. The proposal, however, has been criticized by area residents and environmentalists worried about air pollution. Scott Buschman, a professional photographer and San Bruno resident, said yesterday it was unjust that state officials 100 miles away in Sacramento approved a Texas company's proposal to put a power plant on land owned by San Francisco. \"The fact that they approved it without considering the public's concerns, foremost air quality, is very disturbing,\" he said. Fay said the plant complies with clean-air standards.

Davis's Plan To Power California --- State's Outlays for Electricity May Be Hard to Recover Without Rate Increases --- Betting on Long-Term Deals By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Rebecca Smith, Mitchel Benson and John R. Emshwiller 03/08/2001 The Wall Street Journal A1 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Earlier this year, Gov. Gray Davis made what may be the biggest bet in the history of the nation's biggest state: that he could tame an out-of-control electricity market and avoid devastating blackouts without busting the state's budget, antagonizing its consumers or derailing his own political career. His wager is still on the table, but the assumptions that underlie it are looking increasingly shaky these days. The governor has already spent around $2 billion of public money buying hugely expensive wholesale power, taking over the role formerly played by the state's near-bankrupt electric utilities. And California will probably be obliged to spend billions more before its electricity market stabilizes and those utilities are restored to some semblance of financial health. Under the governor's plan, California aims to recoup the money it is using to buy electricity by issuing $10 billion in bonds. That way it would still have a healthy budget surplus to finance new spending on roads, schools and other public services. But there's a potentially big obstacle to this plan. The state Legislature, worried about racking up billions in new debt, has put limits on the size of any bond offering. In broad terms, the Legislature's action would allow the state to borrow only four times as much as it can recover annually from utility customers. Right now that doesn't appear to be much. Under the current rate structure, essentially set in place by California's flawed 1996 electricity-deregulation plan, consumers pay far less for power than the cost of acquiring it on the wholesale market. Preliminary estimates submitted by utilities last month to the California Public Utilities Commission show the state's share of the proceeds from electricity sales this year could be as little as $241 million -- not enough to support even $1 billion in bond sales under the Legislature's formula. That would leave the state on the hook for much of the money it has already paid for power -- not to mention the billions more Gov. Davis will need to spend. That, in turn, raises the prospect that California's economy and its credit rating both could deteriorate significantly. But state finance officials say that, based on their own projections, they will be able to extract enough money to support a $10 billion bond issue. Walking a careful line between fiscal prudence and political survival, Mr. Davis and others in his administration are scrambling to come up with ways to get around the legislative restrictions without raising rates for consumers. \"If I wanted to raise rates, I could solve this problem in 20 minutes,\" Mr. Davis says. The governor says he believes that the state can obtain enough affordable power through long-term power-supply contracts to avoid the need for a big rate increase. The billions of dollars the state hopes to borrow would be used to help pay for power until electricity prices drop, as they are expected to do when new power plants come online over the next few years. The Davis administration fears that what may be its only other option -- a big increase in retail electric rates -- could prompt angry consumer groups to seek new electricity laws through a statewide ballot initiative during next year's election. That's when Mr. Davis is expected to run for a second term as governor. But trying to save California without rate increases is forcing Mr. Davis to make some colossal gambles with the state's money. State officials estimate that in the next several months, California will need to spend as much as $6 billion on power purchases -- equivalent to the state's entire fiscal surplus. Mr. Davis is also looking to spend several billion more to buy the transmission assets of three investor-owned utilities in order to restore two of them to credit-worthiness. He also has announced plans to spend several hundred million dollars more on conservation programs designed to reduce demand while new power plants are being built in the state. In order to limit the state's financial exposure in the meantime, the governor and his aides have, in some cases, ignored state law. They have threatened appointed officials who have stood in the way. And they have sharply restricted the flow of information to the public. None of those steps is expected to do much to reduce state spending on power in the coming months. In a few weeks, power usage is expected to begin a sharp seasonal rise as Californians switch on their air conditioners with the coming of warmer weather. By various estimates, demand during peak periods this summer could outstrip supply by 10%, or several thousand megawatts. That could produce more rolling blackouts like the ones that hit Northern California earlier this year. It is also likely to put strong upward pressure on wholesale electricity prices. Steven Zimmerman, managing director of Standard & Poor's Corp., says Mr. Davis and his aides don't \"have a lot of time\" to put a cap on the state's financial exposure to the crisis. The credit-rating agency has put the state on credit watch for a possible downgrade, which would affect the value of all of California's outstanding public debt. Moody's Investor Service Inc. is also concerned. It said in a recent report that the power crisis could soon \"seriously threaten the health\" of the state's economy. Mr. Davis, a Democrat and career politician, was dealt a bad hand when he took office in 1999. The deregulation plan that sparked the state's electricity crisis was enacted under his predecessor, Republican Pete Wilson. But Mr. Davis was slow to react to early signs of trouble this past summer and alarms sounded by members of the state Legislature. By the time Mr. Davis finally sprang into action earlier this year, a troublesome power-supply squeeze had escalated into a crisis. In a Jan. 17 declaration of emergency, the governor designated the state Department of Water Resources to take the utilities' place as the daily buyer of huge quantities of electricity. His hope: that by making the state the dominant player in California's power sector, he would ease electricity producers' concerns about getting paid and give the state enough clout to negotiate lower long-term power prices. Earlier this week, Mr. Davis announced final or tentative agreements with 20 power suppliers to furnish the state with a total of 8,900 megawatts for periods of as long as 20 years. But the supply situation remains extremely uncertain for this summer, when demand probably will top 45,000 megawatts. If the state can secure enough power under contract and push down demand through aggressive conservation, it might be able to squeak through the summer season. If not, it will be forced to keep buying huge amounts of costly power in the cash market. Under deregulation, retail electric rates were frozen for several years, while wholesale-power costs were free to fluctuate. When the plan was conceived, wholesale prices were low and expected to go lower. However, a combination of unexpected growth in power demand and a lack of new generating capacity helped produce a supply squeeze. Average wholesale prices more than tripled last year from 1999. And in January those prices were up 10-fold from a year earlier. By then, California's two biggest investor-owned utilities -- the Pacific Gas & Electric unit of PG&E Corp. and the Southern California Edison subsidiary of Edison International -- faced imminent financial collapse. They had racked up billions of dollars in wholesale power bills they couldn't afford to pay. As generators began shying away from selling to the two utilities, the Clinton administration forced them to sell power into the California market, an order left in place during the first weeks of the Bush administration. Still, northern California was hit by rolling blackouts on several days in early January. Since then, the DWR, which does some electricity trading as an adjunct to its main mission of managing the state's giant system of aqueducts and reservoirs, has had to learn the ins and outs of power markets on the run. It hasn't been easy. David Mills, trading-floor manager for the federal Bonneville Power Administration, says the water agency has at times offered to pay $50 to $100 per megawatt hour more than the available market price. \"They agree to prices that make you wonder,\" says Mr. Mills, whose organization markets electricity from federal dams in the Pacific Northwest. \"You'd at least think they'd check to see what the prevailing price is before throwing out their offer.\" Mr. Mills says that \"to cut California some slack,\" he occasionally has instructed his traders to sell at prices lower than the DWR had offered to pay. Ray Hart, the water agency deputy director responsible for the power purchasing, says he isn't aware of any cases in which the DWR has overpaid. He says his team has been \"extremely successful by all measures.\" Ultimately, the DWR's trading acumen is far less important than the overall arithmetic of power supply and demand in California. With the price of natural gas that feeds many of the region's generating plants at near record levels and some suppliers reluctant to sell into the troubled California market, wholesale electric prices remain stubbornly high and, in recent days, have again been rising. The Legislature has advanced the DWR about $3 billion from the state's general fund for power purchases. Under emergency legislation passed by the Legislature and signed by Mr. Davis on Feb. 1, the general fund is to be reimbursed from a planned bond sale later this year. But under terms of the emergency law, the water agency would have to wrest $2.5 billion a year in revenue from retail electricity rates in order to sell the $10 billion worth of bonds sought by Mr. Davis. Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, a Southern California Democrat, says the formula was created to ensure that there would be a way to repay the bonds without draining the state's coffers. \"We didn't want to just open our wallets,\" he says. According to the language of the Feb. 1 law, the water agency gets what's left of revenue collected from ratepayers after the utilities pay certain of their own power-supply bills and other expenses. And, in their filings with the PUC last month, the utilities reckoned, under their worst-case scenarios, that there would be only $241 million available to the DWR this year. State officials are quietly pushing the PUC to rejigger the formula so that the water department gets more money -- even though that would clash with terms of the Feb. 1 law. Robert Miyashiro, deputy director of the Department of Finance, says the emergency law was \"drafted poorly\" and has led people to believe the DWR \"only gets the leftover money.\" He predicts there will be \"cleanup legislation.\" At the request of the Davis administration, the PUC is considering a plan to use a different revenue-sharing formula than the one in the state law. The proposed new formula was written \"in close consultation\" with Mr. Davis's Finance Department, says PUC President Loretta Lynch, who supports the initiative and is hoping to rush it through. The effort has drawn some opposition. Commissioner Richard Bilas at a recent PUC meeting questioned the legality of the commission attempting to change a formula set by the Legislature. PG&E is even more emphatic, since the DWR's extra money could come at the utility's expense. The formula \"threatens to undo the very financial protections for the utilities that [the new law] attempted to provide,\" the utility said in a recent filing with the PUC. As politicians and regulators wrestle with that issue, the Davis administration has taken a step to reduce the outflow of state cash that also seems to conflict with the Feb. 1 law. It was widely assumed that the law required the DWR to buy any electricity the state needed to keep its lights on. However, on many occasions, the DWR has refused to buy power on the grounds that it was too expensive, citing a portion of the new law that urges the agency to hold down costs. The task of covering any remaining shortfall has passed to the California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's energy grid and is charged with buying power when necessary to avert shortages. However, the ISO doesn't have any power-purchasing money of its own, and the major parties it would normally bill are PG&E and Edison, whose inability to pay their power bills was the reason the state started buying electricity in the first place. Amid criticism of its stance from generators, utilities and Wall Street, the DWR says it has started covering more of the utilities' electricity costs. The water agency is now buying 95% to 99% of what California needs in a given day, says the agency's Mr. Hart. But increased buying only adds to the uncertainty about the eventual tab. The state's legislative analyst, Elizabeth Hill, recently recommended that lawmakers hold off considering more than $2 billion in state spending on items ranging from college construction to beach cleanups because of continuing questions about the financial impact of the electricity crisis. Like others, Ms. Hill complains that the governor's office and state agencies haven't been forthcoming with information. Indeed, the DWR refuses to say precisely how much power it is purchasing and at what prices, though it has on several occasions gone back to the Legislature for more money. State officials say that data on its purchasing activities would give suppliers an advantage in continuing electricity-supply contract talks. State Controller Kathleen Connell, who is running for mayor of Los Angeles in an April election, recently announced plans to post state power-spending information on her department's Web site. But within 24 hours, Ms. Connell suspended that plan after discussions with senior Davis administration officials. \"I feel very strongly that this information should be publicly released,\" says Ms. Connell. \"I just don't want to do anything that would weaken the state's effectiveness in negotiating.\" In an effort to more tightly control events, the governor obtained legislative approval to abolish the 26-member ISO board, which was made up of everyone from utility executives to representatives of consumer groups. He then appointed a new five-member board. To ensure a quick transition, the California attorney general threatened the old board members with fines of as much as $5,000 each if they didn't immediately relinquish their positions. All did. \"I was offended\" at the \"heavy-handed\" treatment, says Karen Johanson, a former ISO board member. One of the first acts of the ISO's new board was to close a meeting about the electricity crisis. The former ISO board routinely held such meetings in public. ISO attorneys say the meeting was largely designed as a private briefing for new board members and that the organization is committed to keeping its deliberations as open as possible. The Wall Street Journal and other news organizations have unsuccessfully challenged the closure in Sacramento state court. Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

I cannot give you a personal recommendation per se because, in the end, I opted not to hire an attorney to file my patent until I had decided whether I wanted to protect my work as a trade secret or as a patented commodity. I ultimately struck a compromise position by filing my own \"provisional patent application.\" This establishes the date of my claim and gives me one year in which to finalize the patent? or not; it also provides patent pending protection from the date I filed it with the U.

Of these, I think that perhaps David Richie might be the most appropriate for your son's software idea. He talked as though he had a particular specialty in software issues; he also struck me as competent and aggressive. He practices in the Silicon Valley and can be reached at telephone number (408) 282-1856. I suspect that he has already done so, but if not, your son might want to visit the internet site of the U.

Suppliers deny the= =20 accusation.=20 By TIM REITERMAN and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writers=20 ?????Wholesale electricity suppliers overcharged California by about $5.5= =20 billion between May and last month, and that money should be refunded to th= e=20 state's taxpayers and financially strapped utilities, the state power grid= =20 operator said Wednesday. ?????Generators engaged in market manipulation and consistent patterns of= =20 bidding far above costs in the deregulated energy market, the California=20 Independent System Operator found in a study of pricing data. The findings= =20 support the widespread belief that these suppliers reaped massive additiona= l=20 revenue by manipulating the market. ?????Spokesmen for the companies denied the accusation. ?????The study, prepared for a filing with federal regulators today, is=20 central to Cal-ISO's efforts to seek reimbursement for what it considers=20 excessive charges by electricity suppliers during the state's energy crisis= . ?????\"This might be the first time we told them the total impact and=20 magnitude [of the overcharging],\" said Anjali Sheffrin, Cal-ISO's director = of=20 market analysis. \"We think the entire amount deserves consideration for=20 refunds.\" ?????Using confidential bidding data on tens of thousands of electricity=20 sales, Cal-ISO found that five companies that together supply about 30% of= =20 the power delivered to customers of the state's investor-owned utilities=20 engaged in two types of behavior that tended to push up prices: ?????* They effectively withheld supplies by bidding at excessive prices,= =20 even though they could have made some money selling more electricity. ?????* Less frequently, they had power generation available but did not bid= =20 at all. ?????The study concluded that energy suppliers commonly offered their=20 electricity at twice their cost. For example, Sheffrin said, the average=20 markup in August was 100% during peak hours. ?????A spokeswoman at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which=20 oversees wholesale electricity pricing across the country, declined to=20 comment Wednesday, saying, \"This is part of an ongoing proceeding.\" ?????FERC member William L. Massey, who has considered previous commission= =20 actions on refunds to be inadequate, said it would be improper for him to= =20 comment on a report that has not yet been filed. But when told of the=20 $5.5-billion total, Massey said: \"That doesn't shock me in any way.\" ?????\"Prices over the past 10 months in California have greatly exceeded th= e=20 federal standards of just and reasonable prices, and I think they have=20 exceeded the standards by possibly billions of dollars,\" he said. ?????Cal-ISO, which oversees grid operations and an emergency energy market= ,=20 previously detailed $550 million in alleged overcharges for December and=20 January and asked FERC for refunds. But the commission has proposed refunds= =20 of only a tiny fraction of that amount. ?????The study covered five major in-state power suppliers--Reliant Energy,= =20 Dynegy, Williams/AES, Duke Energy and Mirant, formerly Southern Energy--plu= s=20 16 power importers, all of which deliver power to customers of Pacific Gas = &=20 Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. ?????\"All [21] overcharged, but some excessively and some by moderate=20 amounts,\" Sheffrin said. ?????Cal-ISO's public filing will quantify the alleged overcharging by each= =20 company, but the companies will be identified only by a number. The code wi= ll=20 be provided to FERC, Sheffrin said, and Cal-ISO lawyers will determine how= =20 much information about the companies will be made public. ?????State, U.S. Investigations ?????California electricity markets and the companies that buy and sell pow= er=20 in the state have been the subject of several investigations by state and= =20 federal authorities since wholesale electricity prices first skyrocketed in= =20 May. ?????Electricity suppliers have repeatedly denied manipulating the Californ= ia=20 market in any way, whether through above-cost bidding in spot markets or=20 through physical withholding of electricity to drive up prices. ?????Reliant Energy is cooperating with FERC's requests for more data and i= s=20 confident the commission will conclude that prices charged by Reliant were= =20 justified, said Joe Bob Perkins, president of the Houston-based company. ?????Perkins also bitterly disputed charges that Reliant has shut down unit= s=20 so that it can earn bigger profits on the power sold by the remaining plant= s.=20 These charges have been leveled against all of the power-plant owners in th= e=20 state. ?????Reliant Vice President John Stout said Cal-ISO's calculations typicall= y=20 don't include such fixed costs as salaries, taxes and the interest on bonds= =20 they sold to finance their power plants, which they acquired under terms of= =20 the state's landmark 1996 deregulation law. ?????In addition, he said, many high-priced power days have resulted from= =20 buyers bidding against each other for scarce supplies rather than sellers= =20 charging excessive amounts--like a house price being driven far above the= =20 listing price in a hot real estate market. ?????Williams Energy Services, a trading company that markets most of the= =20 power produced by plants owned by AES, also says it will be exonerated by= =20 FERC once the commission examines documentation being submitted, said Paula= =20 Hill-Collins, spokeswoman for the Tulsa, Okla., company. ?????\"FERC has the obligation to investigate when these accusations are=20 made,\" Hill-Collins said. \"This is just a process of justification, not=20 necessarily proof of guilt.\" ?????Williams/AES was recently ordered by FERC to prove that it did not tak= e=20 generating units out of service last year to drive up electricity prices, o= r=20 refund $10.8 million to California utilities. ?????During the period studied, suppliers sold electricity in the Californi= a=20 Power Exchange to Southern California Edison, PG&E and San Diego Gas &=20 Electric Co. and in a backup market for last-minute electricity operated by= =20 Cal-ISO. But sky-high prices plunged Edison and PG&E deeply into debt, and= =20 most suppliers stopped selling to them in January, forcing the state=20 Department of Water Resources to step in as the primary electricity buyer f= or=20 the three big utilities' 27 million customers. ?????The Cal-ISO study, first summarized at an energy conference last week = at=20 UC Berkeley but not otherwise publicized, concluded that the companies=20 exercised so-called market power to pump up electricity prices. ?????Severin Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at Berkeley, said= =20 Cal-ISO's study is consistent with his research examining pricing practices= =20 in 2000. ?????\"We found several billion dollars . . . in departures from competitive= =20 pricing,\" he said. \"When the market was tight this summer, they were able t= o=20 push up prices, and they did.\" ?????The early warning signs of electricity price spikes, the study found,= =20 appeared in May after two years of relatively stable prices of $30 to $40 p= er=20 megawatt-hour under deregulation. Prices went up during the summer, dipped = in=20 September and October with lower demand, then took off in November and=20 December as weather turned cold and the price of natural gas, which is used= =20 to generate much of the state's electricity, reached record levels. ?????\"There were plant outages, and demand and supply became close,\" Sheffr= in=20 said. \"Whatever price they bid had to be taken, and market power asserted= =20 itself.\" ?????Cal-ISO found that $3 billion of the alleged overcharges occurred=20 between May and November. ?????On Friday, federal regulators ordered six wholesale power suppliers to= =20 refund $55 million to California if they cannot justify prices charged in= =20 February. The refund was limited to power sold that month in excess of $430= =20 per megawatt-hour during Stage 3 power alerts, when supplies are so tight= =20 that rolling blackouts are threatened. (One megawatt-hour is enough=20 electricity to supply 750 typical homes for an hour.) ?????The previous week, FERC ordered 13 suppliers to justify or refund $69= =20 million for power sold in January at prices above $273 per megawatt-hour. ?????Massey opposed the potential refunds as too low because they were=20 limited to hours in which a Stage 3 power emergency was in place and becaus= e=20 the benchmark price set for each month was too high--combining to exempt mo= re=20 than 70,000 transactions from scrutiny. ?????\"We're still looking for our lost wallet under the lamppost, which is= =20 Stage 3 alerts,\" said Massey, one of three commissioners on the five-member= =20 board (two seats are vacant). ?????Generators \"have been given the free and clear,\" he said. ?????\"These tinkling little refunds they have come out with recently are=20 almost a joke,\" said Cal-ISO board member Mike Florio, senior attorney at t= he=20 Utility Reform Network. ?????Resisting Price Caps ?????Cal-ISO contends that the last 10 months have proved that generators c= an=20 no longer be allowed to receive electricity prices that are dictated by wha= t=20 the market will bear. ?????\"FERC granted market-based rate authority on each of these suppliers'= =20 own showing that they could not manipulate prices, yet their actions have= =20 shown the contrary,\" Sheffrin said. \"We feel FERC needs to look at the=20 premise of allowing these generators to continue selling at market-based=20 rates.\" ?????The commission is responsible for ensuring just and reasonable=20 electricity rates.

Unseasonable heat tapered off. The operators of the= =20 statewide power grid relaxed their state of emergency. ?????But plenty of ominous signs remained. Many small producers remained sh= ut=20 down, skeptical about Gov. Gray Davis' plan for utilities to pay them. ?????State Controller Kathleen Connell issued a sharp warning about the hig= h=20 cost of the state's foray into the power business and announced that she wi= ll=20 block an administration request that she transfer $5.6 billion into an=20 account that could be tapped to pay for state purchases of electricity. ?????And a report from the administration summarizing contracts between Dav= is=20 and independent power generators showed that the state has signed contracts= =20 for only 2,247 megawatts of electricity, significantly less than the 6,000 = to=20 7,000 megawatts previously claimed. ?????While there are agreements in principle for the full amount, the repor= t=20 notes that generators can back out of the contracts for a variety of reason= s,=20 including the state's failure to sell bonds to finance power purchased by= =20 July 1. The Legislature has approved plans to sell $10 billion in bonds, bu= t=20 none have yet been issued. ?????\"We are exposed enormously this summer,\" Senate Energy Committee=20 chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) said after looking at the report.= =20 \"We owe the people the truth about how difficult this summer is going to be= .=20 We don't have a power fairy.\" ?????Perhaps most significant, the report suggests that the contracts fall= =20 significantly short of Davis' stated goal of buying no more than 5% of the= =20 state's summer needs on the spot electricity market, where prices can be ma= ny=20 times those of long-term contracts. ?????After reading the report, Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist= =20 who studies the California electricity market, said the numbers suggested= =20 that the state's long-term contracts will cover less than half of what the= =20 state will need this summer. ?????\"We're definitely short this summer, next summer and the summer of=20 2003,\" he said. ?????California was forced to start buying electricity in December--at a co= st=20 of $50 million a day--because producers refused to sell to Southern=20 California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. The two utilities amassed=20 billions of dollars in debt when prices for wholesale power soared on the= =20 spot market. ?????Vikram Budhraja, a consultant retained by Davis to negotiate deals wit= h=20 generators, said the report represents a \"work in progress.\" He said the=20 state may yet sign new contracts. ?????However, Wolak said the contract figures confirm what he and others ha= ve=20 been dreading: that summer is going to be rife with rolling blackouts unles= s=20 serious steps to cut demand are taken immediately. ?????Wolak and other experts say large industrial customers must be switche= d=20 to real-time meters and pricing to persuade them to use the bulk of their= =20 energy at times of low demand. ?????The head of the Energy Foundation, a San Francisco-based nonprofit tha= t=20 promotes sustainable sources of power, made the same proposal to Davis on= =20 Wednesday. ?????\"The government need not ask customers to swelter in the dark this=20 summer,\" foundation President Hal Harvey argued in a letter. ?????He also proposed a crash campaign to boost sales of efficient applianc= es=20 and lightbulbs. He said the state needs to take over the utilities' contrac= ts=20 with alternative energy providers to ensure they stay in business, and sign= =20 new contracts for 1,500 megawatts of new wind power--the cheapest, fastest= =20 and cleanest source of new supply. ?????Davis had proposed a formula Tuesday to force private utilities to pay= =20 the alternative producers, some of which have not been paid since November.= =20 But some of them warned Wednesday that Davis' plan offers them little=20 incentive to turn on their generators. ?????Alternative energy producers supply more than a quarter of the=20 electricity consumed in California. ?????Many producers generate electricity from wind, sun and geothermal=20 sources. But most of them generate power using natural gas--and the cost of= =20 natural gas has been soaring. Several natural gas users said Davis' plan,= =20 which caps rates, won't cover their fuel costs. ?????Davis assumes that the price of natural gas will fall. But small=20 generators say they don't have sufficient purchasing power or sophisticatio= n=20 to gamble on future prices. ?????The Public Utilities Commission is expected to approve Davis' proposal= =20 next week. It offers producers two choices: 7.9 cents a kilowatt-hour if th= ey=20 agree to supply power for five years, or 6.9 cents a kilowatt-hour over 10= =20 years. ?????\"The price of natural gas is higher than that,\" said Marty Quinn,=20 executive vice president and chief operating officer of Ridgewood Power LLC= ,=20 which owns three natural gas-fired co-generation plants. \"If we operate,=20 we'll lose money.\" ?????Ridgewood is not operating, having been cut off by gas suppliers. The= =20 company sued PG&E last month seeking overdue payments and release from its= =20 contracts with the utility. ?????A hearing is scheduled in El Centro today in another lawsuit filed by = a=20 small energy producer, an Imperial Valley geothermal producer that sued=20 Edison for refusing to let it break its contract and sell on the open marke= t.=20 CalEnergy says Edison owes it about $140 million for energy sold since=20 November. ?????A company spokesman, Jay Lawrence, said CalEnergy was going ahead with= =20 its suit despite Davis' proposal. \"We've had promises before,\" he said. ?????In other developments: ?????* A federal judge in Sacramento on Wednesday ordered Reliant Energy of= =20 Houston, a major producer, to continue selling power to California during= =20 emergencies, despite the company's argument that it may not be fully=20 reimbursed. The order will remain in effect for 60 days or until the U.S.= =20 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decides a related case. ?????* Connell said the state budget surplus has shrunk to $3.2 billion=20 because the state has spent roughly $2.8 billion on electricity.

And Gov. Gray Davis announced a proposed=20 solution to one vexing problem: the utilities' failure to pay the state's= =20 small, alternative power generators, many of whom have stopped producing=20 power as a result. ?????Davis called the utilities \"shameful\" for failing to pay, and praised= =20 the alternative power generators, which include solar, wind and geothermal= =20 energy producers, as \"good corporate citizens\" who produced power although= =20 they weren't being paid. ?????\"We are anxious to pay the [small producers], who are dropping like=20 flies,\" Davis said. ?????Despite the progress, it was hard for some people to look on the brigh= t=20 side after enduring outages that took place when the state's hunger for pow= er=20 was almost 50% less than at its summer peak. ?????\"This is a taste, almost like an appetizer, of a really unpalatable me= al=20 that's going to be served up this summer,\" said Michael Shames of the Utili= ty=20 Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, himself a victim of a rolling=20 blackout that hit his office in San Diego early Tuesday. ?????Power officials have warned that this could be a grim summer in=20 California, since demand for electricity sharply rises when people turn on= =20 air conditioners. The state has been struggling to meet its power needs in= =20 recent months because of rising prices and a flawed deregulation plan that= =20 has left the two biggest private utilities on the brink of bankruptcy. Stat= e=20 leaders have so far failed to agree on a comprehensive plan to solve the=20 problems. Wally Quirk teaches a business class in a borrowed classroom Tuesday at=20 Sonoma State after the state's rolling blackouts cut the power to his usual= =20 classroom, which does not have any windows. SCOTT MANCHESTER / The Press Democrat ?????The latest round of blackouts began about 9:30 a.m. Tuesday when the= =20 California Independent System Operator, which runs the statewide grid,=20 determined that the demand for electricity was 500 megawatts more than the= =20 supply--an imbalance that meant the state was short on the power needed to= =20 supply electricity to about 375,000 homes. ?????Grid operators blamed a confluence of events, including warmer weather= ;=20 outages at several major power plants, including one unit of the San Onofre= =20 nuclear power station; a reduction in imports from the Pacific Northwest, a= nd=20 the shutdown of many alternative energy producers. Similar blackouts Monday= =20 were the first since January. ?????The situation improved somewhat by late Tuesday morning, with some=20 supplies restored and Californians conserving energy, and Cal-ISO was able = to=20 halt the rolling blackouts at 2 p.m. ?????Once again, customers of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power= =20 were spared, although the municipally owned utility said its electrical=20 surplus was smaller than usual. The DWP, like Southern California Edison, w= as=20 affected by an outage at the huge Mohave power plant in Nevada, as well as = by=20 planned outages at several of its facilities. ?????As in the past, by far the biggest impact was felt by customers served= =20 by Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility, which cut power to= =20 438,000 homes and businesses. ?????Edison cut power to 47,462 customers in about 40 cities, but eventuall= y=20 was able to avoid blackouts by shutting off the air conditioners of some of= =20 the 118,500 customers who participate in a voluntary cutoff program. ?????San Diego Gas & Electric cut power to 73,400 customers. ?????Innovative Ways of Coping ?????As on Monday, most people took the outages in stride, as an annoying b= ut=20 ultimately unavoidable inconvenience. ?????In Palmdale, four schools lost power during one of the hourlong=20 blackouts, but teachers and students pressed on in the sunlight pouring=20 through windows and skylights. At Barrel Springs Elementary, Principal Cruz= =20 Earls said the biggest problem came when students had to go to the bathroom= :=20 Hand in hand, they made their way through darkened hallways with flashlight= s. ?????All in all, it wasn't a terrible experience. Then again, the weather= =20 wasn't that hot Tuesday, with a high of 79 in Palmdale, so the shutdown of= =20 air conditioners wasn't much of a hardship. \"I don't want to think about th= e=20 conditions this could create in May or June,\" Earls said. ?????Businesses of all kinds complained about the lack of warning for the= =20 outages--and sometimes found innovative ways to get around the problem. ?????Rattled by news reports of Monday's rolling blackouts, El Burrito=20 Mexican Food Products in the city of Industry started its Tuesday shift at = 2=20 a.m. to beat the clock in the event of an outage. That hunch paid off.=20 Workers had just finished cooking and packaging the last batches of salsa a= nd=20 masa when the lights went out at 10:20 a.m. ?????Company owner Mark Roth said the firm will continue working odd hours = to=20 avoid further outages. But he isn't buying the line from the utilities that= =20 they can't provide advance warning because of concerns about looting and=20 rioting. ?????\"We're ready to do whatever it takes to get through this thing,\" he=20 said. \"But they've got to give us some notification.\" ?????At Big O Tires in Elk Grove, just south of Sacramento, owner Daniel Cr= um=20 had his 14 workers take an early lunch break or head to the warehouse to=20 reorganize the goods. Without electricity, they couldn't repair brakes or= =20 align front ends. ?????\"I'd never let them be idle,\" said Crum. ?????At least two minor traffic accidents were blamed on the outages. ?????The blackouts resulted from a convergence of factors. ?????Demand was slightly higher than expected, probably because of=20 unseasonably warm weather. Supplies were tighter than usual, in part becaus= e=20 of several outages, including that at the Mohave plant, half of which was= =20 brought back on line by the end of the day. ?????The San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station was still limping along=20 without power from one of its two 1,100-megawatt units, which was shut down= =20 Feb. 3 after a half-hour fire in a nonnuclear part of the plant. Edison,=20 which operates San Onofre, initially estimated the unit would be out for=20 several weeks but recently said \"extensive damage\" to parts of the turbine= =20 will keep the unit out of commission until mid-June. ?????Shipments from the drought-stricken Pacific Northwest, which generates= =20 most of its electricity from large dams, were also down. ?????\"Each time we take a measurement, we're closer to the all-time record= =20 for the driest year,\" said Dulcy Mahar, spokeswoman for the Bonneville Powe= r=20 Administration, the network of federal dams that provides the region with= =20 much of its electricity. \"We've been doing what we can, but we simply don't= =20 have power to sell.\" ?????Finally, there was the problem of the small and alternative energy=20 producers, which have shut down plants because they haven't been paid by th= e=20 private utilities since November. Those outages have cost the state about= =20 3,000 megawatts of electricity, enough for about 2.3 million homes. ?????\"You're seeing the system freeze up,\" said David Sokol, chairman and C= EO=20 of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co., which runs eight geothermal plants in t= he=20 Imperial Valley through its subsidiary, CalEnergy. His company hasn't shut= =20 down yet, but Sokol said smaller companies couldn't continue to sell their= =20 energy to utilities for free. ?????\"Why should we fund Edison?\" he asked. \"That's just ridiculous.\" ?????A Choice of 2 Rate Plans ?????Davis joined lawmakers in the Capitol on Tuesday to outline his plan t= o=20 get the producers running again. He said utilities have had no right to=20 collect money from ratepayers and then not use the funds to repay the small= =20 producers. The state has spent billions to buy power from large conventiona= l=20 producers on behalf of the utilities but has refused to pick up the tab for= =20 alternative energy. ?????\"The utilities acted in a shameful manner by putting money in their=20 pockets that was designed to pay the [small producers],\" Davis said. ?????The plan outlined by Davis would allow the generators to choose betwee= n=20 two rate plans. They could decide to be paid 7.9 cents per kilowatt-hour ov= er=20 five years or 6.9 cents a kilowatt-hour over 10 years. ?????The utilities must begin paying the generators the new rates beginning= =20 April 1 or face fines, Davis said. ?????The question of how the companies will get paid the about $1.5 billion= =20 they are owed remains unresolved. That issue will be decided in coming week= s=20 as Davis' negotiators continue to work on rescue plans for the state's=20 financially hobbled private utilities. ?????PG&E spokesman Ron Low said the state's largest utility did not take= =20 kindly to Davis' criticism, and noted that the governor's plan is similar t= o=20 a proposal that PG&E made last week to producers. ?????Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of a trade group that includes so= me=20 of the small generators, described the plan as a positive step. ?????\"The governor got it right in that it's not acceptable for small power= =20 producers to continue to generate and not be paid,\" Smutny-Jones said. \"But= =20 we'll need to see what the order says; the devil will truly be in the=20 details.\" ?????Grid operators said the state's overall energy situation eased by midd= ay=20 Tuesday because of repairs at the Mohave plant and another large plant at= =20 Ormond Beach, and because the Western Area Power Administration came up wit= h=20 300 megawatts of electricity from Glen Canyon Dam. ?????Also, grid spokesman Patrick Dorinson said conservation savings spiked= =20 upward after earlier complaints that Californians weren't conserving. ?????\"We saw the people of California probably conserve 900 megawatts today= ,\"=20 he said. \"That was probably the difference.\" ---=20 ?????Times staff writers Andrew Blankstein, Jose Cardenas, Marla Dickerson,= =20 Noaki Schwartz, Nicholas Riccardi, Doug Smith, Rebecca Trounson and Richard= =20 Winton in Los Angeles, Miguel Bustillo and Julie Tamaki in Sacramento, Mari= a=20 La Ganga in San Francisco, Stanley Allison, Matt Ebnet, Scott Martelle,=20 Dennis McLellan, Monte Morin, Jason Song, Mai Tran and Nancy Wride in Orang= e=20 County, and Richard Simon in Washington contributed to this story. --- --- Fragile Supply Network Apt to Fail=20 By JENIFER WARREN and ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writers=20 ?????A lot of people were caught off guard by the blackouts that swept over= =20 California this week.

In fact, they haven't. ?????More than anything, this week's events illustrate the delicate balance= =20 of factors that keep California illuminated, from the multitude of supply= =20 sources to the weather. ?????Temperatures were higher than usual.

At one point Tuesday, about 8,200 megawatts were unavailable=20 because of unscheduled shutdowns.

Firefighters=20 handling blackout-related emergencies rescued a person trapped in a downtow= n=20 building Tuesday and handled five elevator mishaps Monday. ?????Christopher Stafford didn't get caught inside an elevator Monday, but= =20 suffered the next-worst thing: being stranded in his 15th-floor apartment= =20 after the power failed when he went home for lunch. ?????So the 41-year-old real estate worker trooped down the stairs to the= =20 lobby and even made some new friends along the way, helping a few elderly= =20 women who were struggling down the stairs. ?????\"It was a pain,\" he acknowledged. \"But I have to tell you: I really li= ke=20 my panoramic view, so it's worth the hassle.\" ?????Nowadays, Sherrie Tellier makes sure her cellular phone is in hand whe= n=20 she gets in the elevator. She got trapped once before, and the emergency=20 phone didn't work. It's amazing, she said, how small an elevator seems when= =20 you can't get out. \"It's like a broom closet.Now there's a sigh of relief= =20 every time the door opens.\" ?????Some high-rise office workers said Tuesday that they preferred not to= =20 think about the perils of going without power and being vulnerable and=20 isolated so high up. ?????But on the 42nd floor of San Francisco's Transamerica Tower, Sasha=20 Monpere wasn't fazed by the chance that during a blackout, her building's= =20 backup generators wouldn't kick in. ?????\"Hey, I'm young and I'm healthy.

Gray Davis said negotiations to buy the power grid owned= =20 by the state's largest utilities \"are proceeding at an accelerated pace.\" ?????Wall Street consultant Joseph Fichera said talks with Southern=20 California Edison could be wrapped up within days, although those with PG&E= =20 are much less advanced.=20 ?????The administration and PG&E have not reached even an agreement in=20 principle, he said. PG&E, which has more debt than Edison, says its=20 transmission lines are more extensive than those of its Southern California= =20 counterpart. ?????The state wants to buy the utilities' transmission lines and other=20 assets for about $7 billion to provide cash to the utilities, help stabiliz= e=20 the electricity supply and ease the power crunch that has plagued Californi= a=20 for months. To research the grid purchase, Fichera said, the state has had = to=20 pore over 80,000 documents just to assess the utilities' liabilities. ?????\"We are working at a good pace,\" said Fichera, chief executive of the= =20 New York firm Saber Partners. \" . . . If we get to a deal-breaker, it might= =20 be longer.\" ?????By making Fichera, who is also a consultant to the Texas Public=20 Utilities Commission, available to reporters Tuesday, the Davis=20 administration was clearly trying to reassure the public that progress is= =20 being made on the governor's plan to pull the state out of the crisis. ?????Since mid-January, when the big utilities' credit failed and suppliers= =20 stopped selling to them, the state has spent nearly $3 billion buying=20 electricity from a handful of large suppliers in Texas, Oklahoma, Georgia a= nd=20 North Carolina. Not a cent has gone to the hundreds of alternative energy= =20 suppliers in California who provide about a quarter of the state's=20 electricity. ?????The Monday and Tuesday blackouts occurred partly because many of the= =20 cash-strapped alternative suppliers, including solar, biomass and wind powe= r=20 units, cut their normal supply to the system in half. They say Edison and= =20 PG&E have not paid them since November; the utilities say they are out of= =20 cash. ?????Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek) said the plight of the=20 alternative suppliers has dragged on because of the complexity of dealing= =20 with \"almost 700 individual contractors.\" ?????Another delaying factor, said Keeley, who with state Sen. Jim Battin= =20 (R-La Quinta) worked for almost three months to come up with a legislative= =20 plan to lower the small producers' prices, was \"the huge enmity . . .=20 manifested between the utilities and the qualifying facilities. These peopl= e=20 just don't like each other.\" ?????This week's blackouts provided two painful lessons for the Davis=20 administration: ?????* When it comes to electricity, size doesn't matter--every kilowatt=20 counts. During peak use, a small wind power facility in Riverside County ca= n=20 make the difference between full power and blackouts. ?????* There is no such thing as a partial solution. Unless the whole energ= y=20 equation is balanced, the parts don't work. ?????For the Davis plan to work, several key elements need to come together= =20 or utility customers will almost certainly face rate increases above the 19= %=20 already set in motion: ?????* The cost of power purchased by the state must be reduced through=20 long-term contracts with the big out-of-state producers. ?????These contracts, the details of which the Davis administration has kep= t=20 confidential, are still being negotiated by Davis consultant Vikram Budhraj= a=20 of the Pasadena firm Electric Power Group. The administration says it has= =20 concluded 40 contracts with generators, about half of which have been signe= d. ?????According to the most recent statistics released by the Department of= =20 Water Resources, which buys power for the state, current prices are still= =20 well above the rate state Treasurer Phil Angelides says is necessary for a= =20 planned $10-billion bond offering to succeed. ?????The bonds, set for sale in May, will be used to reimburse the state fo= r=20 the money it will have spent by that time to buy electricity. The state is= =20 currently spending at a rate of $58 million a day to buy power. If prices= =20 stay high, the $10 billion in bonds will not cover the state's power=20 purchases by the end of the summer. ?????Angelides says he cannot proceed with bridge financing for the bonds= =20 until the Public Utilities Commission devises a formula to guarantee that a= =20 portion of utility bills will be dedicated to bond repayment. Angelides has= =20 estimated that, under the January law that put the state in the power buyin= g=20 business, the state must be reimbursed $2.5 billion annually, and that $1.3= =20 billion is needed to service the debt. ?????PUC Administrative Law Judge Joseph R. DeUlloa is expected to announce= =20 his ruling on the reimbursement rate later this week, leading to a PUC vote= =20 on the matter as early as next week. ?????* The rates charged for electricity by the alternative producers, know= n=20 as qualifying facilities, must be cut at least in half, down from an averag= e=20 of more than 17 cents per kilowatt-hour. In his news conference Tuesday,=20 Davis said he will ask the PUC to set QF rates at 6.9 cents for 10-year=20 contracts and 7.5 cents for five-year contracts. ?????Meanwhile, PUC Chairman Loretta Lynch, a Davis appointee, said Tuesday= =20 that the commission will vote next week on a proposed order requiring=20 Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric to pay the QFs for=20 electricity in the future. Lynch said a recent PUC assessment showed that t= he=20 utilities have enough cash on hand for that. ?????\"We are trying to make sure the folks providing the power get paid,\"= =20 Lynch said. \"The qualified facilities have demonstrated that they haven't= =20 been paid and that it is impairing their ability to provide power.\" ?????The utilities contend that if they pay the small providers what they o= we=20 them, there will not be enough money left to pay other creditors. ?????\"There is not enough money in the current rate structure to pay the=20 [alternative producers], pay the [Department of Water Resources] and pay th= e=20 utilities for their generation,\" said John Nelson, a spokesman for PG&E. ?????* The utilities must sell to the state the power they produce=20 themselves, mainly from hydro and nuclear sources, at a rate only slightly= =20 above the cost of producing it. This is tied to the ongoing negotiations=20 between the Davis administration and the utilities to restore the=20 near-bankrupt utilities to solvency. ---=20 ?????Times staff writers Julie Tamaki, Miguel Bustillo and Tim Reiterman=20 contributed to this report. --- L.A., Long Beach File Suits Over Gas Companies' Prices=20 Energy: Separate actions allege a conspiracy and gouging.

Critic= s=20 renew call for full disclosure.=20 By DAN MORAIN , Times Staff Writer=20 ?????SACRAMENTO--As part of his closed-door negotiations to buy electricity= ,=20 Gov. Gray Davis has agreed to relieve some generators from having to pay=20 potentially millions of dollars in fees for emitting pollutants into the ai= r,=20 Davis said Tuesday. ?????Davis announced two weeks ago that his negotiators had reached deals= =20 with 20 generators to supply $43 billion worth of power during the next 10= =20 years. ?????However, the Democratic governor has refused to release any of the=20 contracts or detail various terms, contending that release of such=20 information would hamper the state's ability to negotiate deals with other= =20 generators and therefore ultimately would raise prices Californians pay for= =20 electricity. ?????Sources familiar with the negotiations, speaking on condition of=20 anonymity, said the agreement reached with Dynegy Inc., a power company bas= ed=20 in Houston, is one that includes language requiring that the state pay the= =20 cost of credits that allow emissions. Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel declin= ed=20 to discuss the company's deal with the state. ?????\"We couldn't get them to sign contracts; it was a sticking point,\" Dav= is=20 said of the decision to pay the fees of some generators. \"We had to lock do= wn=20 some power so we were not totally dependent on the spot market.\" ?????The fees in question are part of an emission trading system known as= =20 RECLAIM. Under the system, companies are allotted a certain amount of=20 allowable pollution. If their operations pollute more, companies are requir= ed=20 to purchase credits on an open market. Currently the credits cost about $45= =20 per pound of pollution--an amount that can lead to a bill of well over $10= =20 million a year for a power plant. ?????The South Coast Air Quality Management District, which regulates=20 pollution in the Los Angeles Basin, is considering steps to significantly= =20 lower the cost of the system--a step that could considerably cut the state'= s=20 potential cost, Davis said. ?????Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey)=20 defended the decision to cover the power company's costs. ?????\"It is a question of whether it brings down the price of power,\" she= =20 said. \"If it brings down the price of power, I don't have a problem with it= .\" ?????Nevertheless, word that the contracts could bind the state to pay=20 pollution fees caused some critics of Davis' policy to renew calls for Davi= s=20 to reconsider the secrecy surrounding the power negotiations. The payment= =20 provision underscores the fact that the contracts involve more than merely= =20 the prices the state will pay for its megawatts, the critics note. ?????\"The Legislature should have known about it,\" said Senate President Pr= o=20 Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco). \"It is going to cost taxpayers money. It= =20 makes you wonder. . . . This was a policy issue that was never discussed wi= th=20 the Legislature.\" ?????V. John White, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club, who also represents=20 alternative energy producers, called the contract proposal \"a horrible=20 precedent.\" ?????\"Until we know exactly what the state has agreed to and how much of a= =20 subsidy this represents, we can't determine how serious the breach of=20 principle this is,\" White said. ?????Another critic of the secrecy of the negotiations, Terry Francke,=20 general counsel for the California First Amendment Coalition, said the=20 provision in question \"raises the possibility that there are other=20 [concessions]\" that have not yet come to light. ?????In the summer, when demand for power is highest, some generators=20 probably will exceed pollution limits set by regional air quality managemen= t=20 districts. ?????To avert blackouts, state officials might ask the companies to keep=20 plants running. In such cases, some sources familiar with aspects of the=20 contracts said, the contract language could be interpreted to suggest that= =20 the state would cover any fines--although Davis said Tuesday the state will= =20 not cover the cost of fines. ?????A recent Dynegy filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission=20 underscores the rising cost of pollution-related measures. The company, whi= ch=20 is partners with NRG Energy in three California plants in El Segundo, Long= =20 Beach and Carlsbad in San Diego County, said its \"aggregate expenditures fo= r=20 compliance with laws related to the regulation of discharge of materials in= to=20 the environment\" rose to $14.3 million in 2000, from $3.6 million in 1999. ?????A South Coast Air Quality Management spokesman said Dynegy's facilitie= s=20 appear to be fairly clean--although Sierra Club lobbyist White said Dynegy= =20 has been seeking a permit at one of its plants to burn fuel oil, which is= =20 dirtier than natural gas. ?????Davis said he intends to \"make this information public,\" but he added= =20 that \"we do not want to put the public's interest in jeopardy by asking the= m=20 to pay higher prices.\" ?????\"Nobody likes the notion that [the administration is] not being fully= =20 forthcoming,\" Davis said. \"But I also have a corollary responsibility that = I=20 don't stick these generators with a higher rate.\" --- As Losses Mount, Companies Work Around Outages=20 By MARLA DICKERSON,JERRY HIRSCH and NANCY CLEELAND, Times Staff Writers=20 ?????As blackouts moved from theory to reality, many Southern California=20 businesses spent Day 2 assessing their losses and digging in for what they= =20 expect to be a long, hot summer. ?????An hour without electricity may be an inconvenience for most residents= .=20 But for manufacturers and many other businesses, even a brief loss of power= =20 can generate tens of thousands in losses. ?????Whether shaping metal or making salsa, businesses of all kinds=20 complained Tuesday about the lack of warning of impending outages, even as= =20 they sought sometimes creative ways to work around the loss of power. ?????Rattled by news reports of Monday's rolling blackouts, Industry-based = El=20 Burrito Mexican Food Products started its Tuesday shift at 2 a.m. Workers h= ad=20 just finished cooking and packaging the last batches of salsa and masa when= =20 the lights went out at 10:20 a.m. ?????\"We dodged a bullet,\" said El Burrito founder Mark Roth. \"Losing a day= 's=20 production of salsa would have cost me $15,000 to $20,000.\" ?????But other companies weren't so fortunate. ?????Long Beach-based Delco Machine & Gear was still totaling up its losses= =20 from Monday's blackout, which amounted to at least $30,000 in lost wages an= d=20 production, said Nick Campanelli, vice president of manufacturing. The=20 company, a division of Florida-based B/E Aerospace Inc., makes parts for th= e=20 aerospace industry. The sudden loss of power caused its sophisticated metal= =20 cutting and grinding machines to crash, ruining precision parts in producti= on. ?????But the losses don't end there. He said employees will need to spend= =20 hours resetting the equipment. Campanelli is particularly irked that the=20 company received no warning. ?????\"Five minutes' notice,\" he fumed. \"That's all I needed.\" ?????Although businesses such as Campanelli's typically receive no warning= =20 that they are about to lose power, insurance companies count the rolling=20 blackouts as \"planned events,\" a determination that in most cases=20 disqualifies a business from making a claim. ?????\"I know it must be frustrating for businesses who have the power go of= f=20 suddenly, but these outages are planned by the grid operators,\" said Pete= =20 Moraga of the Insurance Information Network of California. \"That means it= =20 would not be a covered peril in a traditional business insurance policy.\" ?????Typically, business insurance covers loss of profit and damage from=20 unforeseen events such as fires or windstorms.

Gray Davis' demand for $8.9 billion in refunds was too high and that a= =20 settlement probably would be in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion.=20 The disclosure that Wagner had contemplated a much higher figure midway=20 through the negotiations suggests the state had more support than the judge= =20 let on Monday when he said after the talks foundered that he thought a deal= =20 should involve \"hundreds of millions, maybe a billion\" dollars.=20 While the state wants $8.9 billion, $3 billion of that was for overcharges= =20 during the five months preceding last October and are beyond FERC's scope o= f=20 review. Even as a starting point then, the $4.5 billion mentioned by Wagner= =20 represented 75 percent of the money the state was demanding for alleged pri= ce=20 gouging between October and May.=20 The judge's $4.5 billion figure, divided between cash payments and savings= =20 from long-term power contracts, was confirmed by three sources who asked to= =20 be identified only as \"close to the negotiations\" because participants had= =20 been required to sign confidentiality statements.=20 The sources gave virtually identical accounts of a July 2 meeting with Wagn= er=20 in which the judge also dismissed as \"inadequate\" a $670 million settlement= =20 offer made by power generators and marketers.=20 By Monday, the settlement offer had risen to $716 million. But the state=20 refused to back off its $8.9 billion demand, and there never was any seriou= s=20 back-and-forth negotiations during the 15-day period the regulatory=20 commission had given Wagner to craft a deal.=20 As a consequence of the failed talks, Wagner said Monday that within a week= =20 he will send the five-member commission his recommendations on how it might= =20 approach an order refunding power overcharges.=20 Among Wagner's suggestions is that the commission convene a hearing before = a=20 different administrative judge to take testimony from generators, marketers= =20 and the state on how to arrive at a fair settlement.=20 The options sketchily outlined by Wagner on Monday included limiting the ti= me=20 when refunds are allowed -- something that could reduce state claims by abo= ut=20 one-third -- and changing the way power plant costs are calculated to a=20 formula more favored by generators.=20 It is not clear whether Wagner, who moved from one negotiating team to=20 another during his two-week quest for a deal, ever raised the $4.5 billion= =20 settlement figure to the power marketers and generators.=20 Joel Newton, who represented Dynegy Power, Duke Energy, Reliant Energy,=20 Williams-AES and Mirant in the talks, said Tuesday he was bound by the=20 confidentiality pledge to keep silent on the internal negotiations.=20 Wagner also is refusing all media calls.=20 According to the account of the negotiations confirmed by sources Tuesday,= =20 Wagner was angry at the snail's pace of progress after the first week of th= e=20 talks.=20 On Friday, June 29, Wagner called everyone into his hearing room and scolde= d=20 them.

Gray Davis,\" reported the Register yesterday. Even= =20 that $1 billion amount might be balanced by the amount the state still owes= =20 the power producers.=20 To suggest workable and market-oriented solutions to the California=20 electricity crisis. Judge Curtis Wagner's recommendation will be taken up by the Federal Energy= =20 Regulatory Commission, which is being petitioned for the money by the state= =20 of California.=20 Because the judge's words will bolster FERC's apparent desire not to grant= =20 the \"refunds,\" the state probably will go to court, where the matter could = be=20 stuck for years. \"In the long term, this may indicate that competitive electricity has a=20 future even in California, but not thanks to the state,\" Robert Michaels, a= =20 professor of economics at Cal State Fullerton, told us. He's referring to t= he=20 state's botched 1996 \"deregulation\" effort, which has been made worse by Go= v.=20 Gray Davis and other officials since the crisis began a year ago. \"FERC since the 1980s favors competition, within the parameters of politica= l=20 reality,\" Mr. Michaels added. \"Now we're at square one: The industry doesn'= t=20 owe $9 billion to California.\" As this process continues, he said, another= =20 positive aspect will be that a lot of facts will get aired. \"We'll see what= =20 has been happening in the markets\" in which power is bought and sold. Second, light already is shining on one area: This crisis was not \"Made in= =20 Texas'' by cronies of President Bush, as Gov. Davis and other Democrats hav= e=20 been contending.=20 In May, the governor attacked the president for ignoring \"the greed of thes= e=20 Texas energy companies,\" such as Reliant and Dynergy. In fact, according to information on state power contracts the governor=20 finally released Monday, Texas companies were way down on the list of=20 producers.=20 \"In roughly the first five months of the year, the state shelled out $1.2= =20 billion to Atlanta-based Mirant, the most any company was paid for=20 electricity, followed by $1 billion to Powerex, the marketing arm of BC Hyd= ro=20 in British Columbia [in Canada]. It also paid $331 million to the Los Angel= es=20 Department of Water and Power,\" reported the San Jose Mercury News. Only about 10 percent of our state's power during this period came from=20 companies with headquarters in Texas. Third, and finally, a new study by the Cato Institute shows what should be= =20 done next:=20 lAbolish retail rate caps, allowing prices to be set by the market.=20 This would be a better system than the present one, where the state buys th= e=20 electricity and passes much of the cost along through the state budget (pai= d=20 by taxpayers) and bonds paid for by long-term electricity price increases.= =20 Higher immediate prices would encourage conservation and production, leadin= g=20 in time to lower prices. lMove to real-time pricing so people shift activities such as washing to=20 off-peak hours.=20 lAbolish the Independent System Operator, which moves electrons around.=20 Give this function back to the utilities, who did it far better before=20 \"deregulation.\" Gov.

First, I apologize for my prolonged recent absences. I have had two long-standing academic projects: one was due 4/19 (it was on \"final review\" - a paper about corporate political strategy - and just was accepted for publication at our top academic journal) and another is due 5/31. The 5/31 paper was commissioned long ago but is a key paper in a June conference (topic is methods to study corporate political activities and the public affairs function). In order to get it done properly, I need to forego any work at Enron until later in the month. A project of interest to me at Enron - and I hope one that you also have interest - is assessing the effectiveness of governmental affairs. John told me that he conducted such a study for the group last year. One of the methodological challenges is to calculate the benefits that government affairs brings - especially in a system where, for example, on the legislative side, much of the \"work\" of government affairs is to block legislation at very early stages. I suspect that govt. affairs needs to justify its existence for internal budgets at Enron and thus the benefits of the function are important to quantify. I'd like to review any of the previous work and make suggestions as necessary. At some point, let me know how you would like to proceed. Otherwise, I hope all is well with you all.

Donnelly could lead to a= =20 mass exodus by hundreds of small energy producers that have been selling=20 power to the state's financially troubled utilities for months without=20 getting paid. ?????At the same time, it may have staved off plans by a group of the small= =20 generators to send Edison into involuntary bankruptcy as early as today. ?????In Sacramento, energy legislation pushed by Gov. Gray Davis passed in= =20 the state Senate but foundered in the Assembly. The measure was intended to= =20 ensure that the state gets repaid for the electricity that it has been buyi= ng=20 on behalf of Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric, which say they lack the cas= h=20 and credit to purchase power. The bill also was supposed to guarantee that= =20 the small, alternative energy producers--which together provide nearly a=20 third of the state's power--get paid. But Assembly Republicans opposed it,= =20 saying it hadn't been given sufficient scrutiny. ?????The impact of the small producers was made clear in Imperial County,= =20 where Edison's failure to pay CalEnergy, the county's biggest property=20 taxpayer, had outsize implications. CalEnergy had put county officials on= =20 notice that it was about to miss a $3.8-million property tax payment. The= =20 uncertainty had prompted the tiny Calipatria Unified School District to=20 postpone a bond issue for badly needed school repairs. ?????Among CalEnergy Chairman David Sokol's first acts after the judge's=20 ruling Thursday was to promise Imperial County Supervisor Wally J. Leimgrub= er=20 that the company would pay its property taxes on time. ?????\"That is great news,\" Leimgruber said. ?????Within hours of its court victory, CalEnergy had stopped transmitting= =20 geothermal power to Edison and begun selling it to El Paso Energy, a=20 marketing company that purchased the energy at prevailing rates and resold = it=20 on the spot market. ?????Some of the more than 700 other small energy producers in the state sa= id=20 they were considering similar action against Edison and Pacific Gas &=20 Electric. ?????\"We absolutely need the right to sell to third parties,\" said Dean=20 Vanech, president of Delta Power, a New Jersey company that owns five small= =20 gas-fired plants in California and is owed tens of millions of dollars by= =20 Edison. ?????Sokol praised the Imperial County judge and said his company simply=20 wanted the authority to sell its power \"to a credit-worthy company that, in= =20 fact, pays for the power.\" ?????An Edison spokesman said the company was disappointed with the ruling,= =20 but sympathized with CalEnergy and other small producers because=20 \"California's power crisis has placed [them] in financial distress, just as= =20 it has placed utilities in financial distress.\" ?????Edison expressed concern that the ruling would prompt CalEnergy and=20 other small producers to sell their power out of state. Sokol said CalEnerg= y=20 had specifically told El Paso Energy that it hoped its power would remain i= n=20 California, \"but if someone wants to pay a higher price out of state, we=20 can't stop them.\" ?????Sokol said that Edison still owes CalEnergy $140 million and that the= =20 company--along with seven other small producers--had been prepared to file = a=20 petition in federal bankruptcy court in Los Angeles today forcing the utili= ty=20 into involuntary bankruptcy. He said his company no longer intends to do so= ,=20 and he believed--but wasn't certain--that the other companies would shelve= =20 their plans. ?????Edison filed papers Thursday with the federal Securities and Exchange= =20 Commission showing that it owed $840 million to various small electricity= =20 producers, many of which rely on renewable energy sources such as geotherma= l=20 steam, solar energy or wind. ?????The alternative energy producers--and utilities--strenuously objected = to=20 the legislation considered in Sacramento on Thursday. The bill, spelling ou= t=20 how the utilities are to pay the state and the small producers, passed the= =20 Senate on a 27-9 vote, the exact two-thirds margin required. But it stalled= =20 in the Assembly on a 46-23 party-line vote, well short of two-thirds. ?????\"When I was a citizen back in Lancaster, I heard these stories about= =20 pieces of legislation that were cooked up late at night, that . . . were cu= t=20 and pasted together and were rammed through by the Legislature,\" Assemblyma= n=20 George Runner (R-Lancaster) said. \"That's exactly what we have before us.\" ?????The alternative electricity generators, including oil companies, warne= d=20 that they would lose money under the Davis proposal, while representatives = of=20 Edison and PG&E, which have amassed billions in debt in the worsening energ= y=20 crisis, said the legislation would push them deeper into the hole. ?????\"There isn't enough money,\" Edison attorney Ann Cohn testified at a=20 Senate hearing on the bill Thursday. \"It is a very simple question: Dollars= =20 going out cannot be greater than dollars coming in.\" ?????The bill, AB 8X, combined several proposals. First, it sought to clari= fy=20 earlier legislation by spelling out that Edison and PG&E must pay the state= =20 all money collected from consumers for electricity that the state has been= =20 buying. ?????Additionally, the bill would turn over to the California Public=20 Utilities Commission the thorny issue of how much to pay alternative energy= =20 producers for their electricity. ?????Wind, solar and geothermal producers might agree to the prices offered= =20 by the administration.

Montali pointed out that the department still could demand=20 reimbursement from PG&E.=20 Under the agreement, the ISO will not press any claims against PG&E on beha= lf=20 of generators if they are not paid.=20 The proposed preliminary injunction was based on an April order by the=20 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which forbade the ISO from purchasing= =20 power on behalf of any non-creditworthy buyer, such as PG&E.=20 The ISO is appealing the FERC order. If the appeal succeeds, the injunction= =20 will end.=20 Peter Schrag: Turning up the heat in Houston and Washington (Published June 6, 2001)=20 Behind all the palaver about the predictable standoff at last week's energy= =20 \"summit\" between President Bush and Gov. Gray Davis, one major political=20 development was missed.=20 Put simply, in the past month the focus of the California energy crisis, an= d=20 maybe the onus as well, has moved east: from the state's (and Davis')=20 handling of the mess to the generating companies, energy marketers and gas= =20 pipeline companies that have richly profited from it, and thus to FERC, the= =20 do-next-to-nothing Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the Bush=20 administration.=20 That wasn't all Davis' doing -- far from it -- though it's been at the hear= t=20 of his message about energy industry \"pirates\" and \"profiteers.\" Bush's=20 misbegotten energy plan and the administration's political clumsiness also= =20 contributed mightily, not least by inadvertently giving Davis the chance to= =20 get media exposure he could only have dreamed about.=20 More important, there's the defection of Sen. James Jeffords from the=20 Republican Party and the resulting shift of control in the U.S. Senate, whe= re=20 the next chair of the Energy Committee will be Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New=20 Mexico, a co-sponsor of Sen. Dianne Feinstein's bill capping wholesale=20 electric rates for the next two years. And chairing the Committee on=20 Governmental Affairs will be Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, who's=20 already asked for an audit of energy prices.=20 Those changes will draw a lot more attention to recent studies showing that= a=20 handful of big generators -- Duke Power, Reliant, Mirant, Dynegy and the hu= ge=20 energy-marketing firm Enron -- have gamed the market to drive wholesale=20 prices to levels that, in the year 2000, sometimes reached 40 times the=20 prices of the year before.=20 The findings come not merely from economists at the California Independent= =20 System Operator, the agency that manages the state's grid, who estimate=20 overcharges resulting from market power at $6.2 billion for last year alone= .=20 They come also from Severin Borenstein and his colleagues at the University= =20 of California Energy Institute, who \"conservatively\" calculate the=20 overcharges at $4.5 billion; from Paul Joskow, a widely respected energy=20 economist at MIT; and from Edward Kahn, an economic analyst in San Francisc= o.=20 In a recent paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research,=20 Joskow and Kahn conclude that there's \"considerable evidence that the high= =20 prices experienced in the summer of 2000 reflect the withholding of supplie= s=20 from the market by suppliers [generators or marketers] exercising market=20 power.\" That those high prices occurred not merely during peak usage but al= so=20 at off-hours, when no one had ever seen a price spike before, makes those= =20 spikes even more curious.=20 There is, in addition, the powerful suspicion that the huge increase in=20 natural gas prices that a subsidiary of El Paso Energy Co., now the largest= =20 gas company on Earth, was charging on the California side of the=20 California-Arizona border wasn't merely the result of an innocent imbalance= =20 between supply and demand.=20 None of that may be illegal. If there's no collusion, there are no violatio= ns=20 of antitrust laws. But it adds plenty of steam to the political argument. I= n=20 the 2000 election cycle alone, energy companies kicked in some $64 million = in=20 political contributions, 75 percent of it to Republicans. At a time when=20 those companies, many of them located in the same Houston neighborhood, are= =20 racking up astronomical profits and when their collective coziness with Bus= h=20 and the Republican Party is a lot more than rhetoric, their vulnerability t= o=20 a vigorous Senate investigation ought to be obvious.=20 The clincher is \"Blackout,\" a \"Frontline\" program that both symbolizes the= =20 shifting emphasis and reinforces it. (The program is scheduled to be aired = at=20 8 p.m. Friday on Sacramento cable Channel 7.) It isn't another recital of= =20 Californians worrying about their electric bills, or about the stupidity of= =20 the state's deregulation scheme or how Davis dithered in addressing the=20 crisis. It is about those generators and marketers in Houston and North=20 Carolina, men (and a few women) who regard themselves as the heroes of the= =20 new energy markets.=20 The piece is reported by Lowell Bergman, who in working for both \"Frontline= \"=20 and the New York Times has already broken major print stories about Duke=20 Power's secret approach to Davis offering unspecified energy refunds in=20 return for an end to state investigations and lawsuits.

Is trading an insider's game?=20 Buying, selling of electricity is a growth business, but some say deck is= =20 stacked against consumers By Craig D. Rose=20 UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20 June 6, 2001=20 While Californians decry deregulation's failure to deliver a competitive=20 market, electricity wholesalers have quietly developed a vast and rapidly= =20 growing business of buying and selling power among themselves.=20 The deals take place on high-tech trading floors in Houston and elsewhere= =20 around the country, as well as on Internet-based trading systems.=20 Some experts say this electricity trading is a key mechanism for raising=20 consumer power prices, yet it's largely unregulated.=20 \"Electricity trading is like buying stock -- when you have ability to chang= e=20 the stock price,\" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economics profess= or=20 and member of the state grid operator's market surveillance group.=20 Energy companies say the buying and selling of contracts to deliver power= =20 provides risk management, allowing plant owners to presell their electricit= y,=20 lock in prices and avoid fluctuations. The rough and tumble of the free=20 market, they add, is the most efficient means of allocating a resource like= =20 electricity.=20 But industry critics say trading is far from a competitive market paradigm.= =20 In their view, it's a means of communication -- a way for energy insiders t= o=20 collude and raise prices under the guise of competition.=20 To be sure, the trading arms of major energy companies have emerged as star= s=20 in an industry where profit surges of 300 percent or 400 percent are not=20 uncommon.=20 The transactions, shrouded in secrecy, can leave ownership of a critical=20 commodity in unknown hands. Consider the case of power generated by AES=20 Corp.'s California plants.=20 In 1998, AES made a bold move. Immediately after purchasing power plants th= at=20 gave it control of 10 percent of the state's electric generating capacity,= =20 the company sold the output from its plants for the next 20 years to Willia= ms=20 Cos.=20 Williams did not sit on this treasure trove of electrons. The Tulsa, Okla.,= =20 company soon sold 80 percent of what it bought.=20 It is difficult to say who owns that power now. Some might be owned by Semp= ra=20 Trading, a sister company of SDG&E. Or some could be owned by Enron Corp.,= =20 the nation's biggest electricity trader.=20 A spokeswoman for Williams conceded that Williams itself may have repurchas= ed=20 some of the electricity it sold earlier. But trading companies closely guar= d=20 their positions.=20 This much can be said with certainty: Electricity that AES sold for less th= an=20 5 cents per kilowatt-hour to Williams changed hands perhaps 10 times in the= =20 wholesale market and emerged at times in recent months with a price tag for= =20 consumers that was 300 percent higher.=20 Williams' trading profits increased by 523 percent in the first quarter thi= s=20 year. Advance sales All this buying and selling creates curious confluences.=20 In their attempt to deflect criticism over high prices, generating companie= s=20 such as Duke Energy -- operator of the South Bay Power Plant in Chula and= =20 others in the state -- frequently note that they sell most of their=20 electricity far in advance. But they acknowledge less often that their=20 trading units may also be buying power, which could boost the company's=20 electricity inventory.=20 Duke was the fourth biggest electricity trader last year and cited its=20 trading activity as a prime contributor to its wholesale business profits,= =20 which soared 324 percent in the first quarter to $348 million.=20 It is a company's power traders who frequently direct plant operators to=20 increase or decrease the generation of power in response to market=20 conditions.=20 Energy companies have little option but to turn to trading for profits. One= =20 of the better kept secrets of electrical deregulation and its promise of=20 competition is that there is remarkably little competition in the productio= n=20 side of the business.=20 For one thing, electricity is a commodity; power from one company is=20 indistinguishable from that generated by others.=20 More important, nearly all modern plants generate power from turbines built= =20 by a handful of manufacturers. The result? Modern plants owned by different= =20 companies produce power at nearly identical cost.=20 \"The cost of power produced by modern plants is all within a mil=20 (one-thousandth of a dollar),\" said Michael Peevey, an adviser to Gov. Gray= =20 Davis and former president of Southern California Edison.=20 So the extraction of profit in the electricity business relies much more on= =20 trading. Traders' profits rise when prices are volatile -- plunging, or eve= n=20 better, rising sharply. Little regulation But despite the obvious temptation to manipulate the market, the burgeoning= =20 electricity trading business has remained largely unregulated.=20 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission does require quarterly filings fro= m=20 energy traders, but these often provide incomplete information, or at least= =20 little that has been of concern to FERC.=20 In fact, although the trading of electricity grew more than a hundredfold= =20 from 1996 to 2000, FERC has taken no major enforcement action against a=20 trader. After the onset of the California crisis last year, FERC has acted= =20 once. That was against Williams, which agreed to pay $8 million without=20 admitting guilt to resolve an allegation that it withheld supply to pump up= =20 prices.=20 FERC's record of enforcement in the area of power trading stands in contras= t=20 to a long list of enforcement actions within other markets taken by the=20 Securities Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission= .=20 FERC has recently added staff to its market oversight operations. But Willi= am=20 Massey, a FERC commissioner, says the agency's effort is still inadequate.= =20 \"Electricity can be flipped, stripped and chopped up,\" Massey said. \"It's a= n=20 extraordinarily complicated market.=20 \"The sophisticated marketers and traders have simply moved past us. We're= =20 kind of horse and buggy in our approach and they're out there in rocket shi= ps=20 flying around ... The problem is that sophisticated traders don't necessari= ly=20 produce reasonable prices. They produce profits.\"=20 Before deregulation, electricity trading was a low-key affair. Regulated=20 utilities dealt power back and forth on a reciprocal basis to fill=20 electricity shortfalls in their control areas. There was little trading for= =20 profit until the mid-1990s, after federal legislation and FERC rulings open= ed=20 the market.=20 Major traders include large energy companies, sister companies of=20 California's major utilities and Wall Street firms. Market volatility In many ways, the trading of power is similar to that of other commodities.= =20 But there are important differences. Because it cannot be stored and its us= e=20 is so fundamental, the price of electricity is the most volatile of all.=20 When supplies are tight, a single supplier can rapidly raise prices to=20 budget-busting levels, as evidenced by Duke Energy's recent admission that = it=20 charged California nearly $4,000 for a megawatt-hour of power, a quantity= =20 that probably sold hours earlier for one-tenth of that sum or less.=20 Wolak, the Stanford economist, and state Sen. Joseph Dunn, D-Garden Grove,= =20 who is investigating the state power market, say trading allows companies t= o=20 collude under the guise of competition. Instead of wringing out lowest cost= s,=20 the wholesale trading market serves to raise prices, they say.=20 \"As I trade to you and you trade to me, we communicate to each other what= =20 price we would like to get,\" said Wolak. \"It's not collusive. It's just=20 communicating price.\"=20 Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, the nation's biggest power trader, said= =20 California's problem is not the result of trading.=20 \"It's a result of shortages,\" Palmer said.=20 Underscoring its emphasis on trading, Enron's new headquarters tower in=20 downtown Houston rises from a six-story block of new trading floors,=20 including expanded space for electricity trading.=20 Enron also pioneered trading in cyberspace and its Enron Online site claims= =20 to be the most active computer-based trading market.=20 The Houston company argues that consumers won't fully benefit from power=20 trading and deregulation until they have greater choice in choosing their= =20 power supplier. And the company says FERC has not done enough to open acces= s=20 to transmission lines, which would allow traders to move power around the= =20 country. To that end, Enron has lobbied hard for President Bush's plan for = a=20 national electricity grid.=20 Palmer says the notion that the price of electricity rises each time it is= =20 traded is mistaken.=20 \"The market is always looking for the real price of a commodity,\" Palmer=20 said.=20 Dunn, the California state senator, says his investigation found a differen= t=20 function for trading. At a time when supply barely meets or falls short of= =20 demand, he noted, companies with electricity to sell have to worry only abo= ut=20 how high to set their price.=20 \"The trader is a pawn in the generator's game to drive up prices,\" said Dun= n.=20 \"Trading develops a level of trust. You, my alleged competitor, will bid in= =20 the same patterns and I will respond not in a competitive pattern but in a= =20 complimentary pattern.\"=20 The state senator said his investigation found evidence that on several day= s,=20 energy companies appeared to test their ability to drive prices up, without= =20 being undercut by competitors.=20 This ability to drive up prices without competitive consequence is a key te= st=20 of market power, the technical term for manipulation or price fixing.=20 But Dunn also conceded that antitrust violations can be hard to prove in=20 court. He suggested that even if the trading behavior falls short of=20 antitrust violations, it remains anti-competitive and devastating for the= =20 California economy.=20 To Harry Trebing, a utility industry expert and professor emeritus at=20 Michigan State University, wholesale electricity trading is reminiscent of= =20 what took place in the 1920s and early '30s. Back then, utility companies= =20 created complex networks of holding companies that traded stock among=20 themselves, driving up prices in the process.=20 Undoing that scheme was a focus of President Franklin Roosevelt's=20 administration. Congress ended up barring national power companies and=20 tightening regulation of utilities, in an effort to counteract their tenden= cy=20 to create markets that work only for insiders.=20 \"The broad goals of trading are the same,\" Trebing said.=20 \"The goal is to maximize profits through raising prices.\"=20 Daily energy costs for state fall in past weeks=20 By Ed Mendel=20 UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20 June 6, 2001=20 SACRAMENTO -- In some of the first good news of the electricity crisis, the= =20 Davis administration said yesterday that the daily cost of power purchased = by=20 the state for utility customers has dropped in recent weeks.=20 The price-drop news comes after an announcement that Californians conserved= =20 more energy than expected last month, 11 percent, and amid Davis=20 administration optimism that the Legislature may finally begin to move on a= =20 plan to keep Southern California Edison out of bankruptcy.=20 The developments, if they turn out to be a trend and not temporary, could b= e=20 among the first signs that Gov.
